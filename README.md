##What?
A responsive website aimed to teach students the fundamental topics around investing. 
Some of the topics covered throughout the website are:
- Various investment vehicles such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds
- Investment accounts & their corresponding tax structure within Canada
- Inflation, Interest Rates as well as types of investment risks

##Goal?
Financial and investment literacy is something that students especially in highschool should be learning about. A basic understanding of core investing principles at an early age will lead to a better chance at financial security in the future. The overarching goal of the site is to explain topics that might seem complex, in a very methodical and simple manner. The entirety of the site can be read in 10-15 minutes and what I hope is that it gives the reader a very broad understanding each of the topics covered so they can further explore what they need and find interesting.

##Technologies Used?
Bootstrap, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
