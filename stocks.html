          <h3 class='underline'>Startup</h3>
          <p>
          A <b>startup</b> refers to an early-stage company that is in the midst of creating a product/service with the end goal of bringing it to market.
          <b>Ownership and control</b>  are divided amongst the creators and other employees via <b>shares</b>, which can be thought of as very small pieces of a company.
          Generally, those who own the greatest number of shares  have the most control over what a company does and will decide to do in the future.
          Initially, the founders possess the greatest number of shares and the remaining are split between employees, advisors, etc.
          Shares are split like this in order to enable founders to sway major company decisions in their favour, while keeping their employees invested in the company and excited for its future.
          The ownership of shares also outline the division of profits if a company is doing well, as well as the divison of assets upon the disolution(closing) of a company.
          </p>

          <h3 class='underline'>How startups raise capital</h3>

          <p>
          Besides ownership, one of the biggest challenges for startups and the reason why most aren’t successful, is because of their <b>inability to raise enough capital</b>.
          A great deal of money is required in order to take a concept, turn it into a product/service and finally bring it to market.
          Unfortunately, startups don’t have much capital to spare because in most cases, founders, their family and friends, along with other small investors are responsible for funding the project during its very early stages.
          However, at some point or another, that money will run out and in order
          to keep the business growing, additional capital is required.
          This is where <b>Venture Capitalists(VC)</b> and <b>Private Equity(PE) Firms</b> come in; They financially support the company by providing capital and also do other things such as advising the company on the best course of actions in certain scenarios or
          connecting them with the right people in the industry. However,in exchange for all of this help, they take an <b>equity stake</b> in the company. Prior to this,
          a start-up has only issued shares a small number of times. Once when the share/corporate structure was established, and a few other times for early investors and employees. Once the process of raising capital is in full swing, more and more shares are subsequently <b>issued</b> in order to <b>compensate</b> those that make contributions.
          VC's make large contributions in order to acquire a relatively large percentage of a start up. Along with PE firms, their main job is to look for companies with potential, invest in them early on and hopefully have it pay off in the end when the company becomes successful.
          </p>
          <p>
          One thing to keep in mind is that shares of startups/private companies do not have a <b>price tag</b> on them.
          Potential investors will do tons of research and work with advisors in the company to come up with the company's value at the time of the investment.
          After this is done, the investor can choose to invest a sum of money in exchange for a percentage of the company. For example, say a private investor wants to invest in startup XYZ.
          The founders and the private investor agree that the company is worth <b>$1,000,000</b>. Therefore, in exchange for <b>$200,000</b> the investor will receive <b>20%</b> of the company.
          This 20% comes in the form of shares, which will then be issued in order to fairly compensate the investor for their investment. It's important to note that the since the number of shares outstanding are <b>increasing</b>, the value of each individual share is <b>decreasing</b>. To make it easier to understand
          think of a company as a pie. The actual size of the pie will never change but every time someone wants a piece of it, someone else's piece becomes smaller.
          When this happens to a company's shares/ownership, it's known as <b>dilution</b>. Watch this brief <a href="https://youtu.be/rRGRpKGTCV0" target="_blank">video</a> to get a better idea of exactly how it works.
          </p>


          <h3 class='underline'>Primary Market</h3>
          <p>
          As a startup is rapidly growing in size and gaining popularity, more and more money is required keep them on that trajectory. At some point, even the biggest VC's and PE firms are going to stop putting money into a start-up because they're not willing to take on additional risk.
          In order for the business to continue its growth, pay off outstanding debt or fund new ventures in future years, a larger than usual sum of capital is raised.
          One of the many ways a company can raise this capital is through an <b>Initial Public Offering(IPO)</b>.
          An IPO is when a company decides to give the <b>public</b> an opportunity to buy <b>newly</b> issued shares directly from them. Capital is not the sole reason why some companies decide to IPO.
          An IPO can enhance a company’s public image, give them prestige and really cement them in a given marketplace.
          </p>

          <p>
          An IPO is referred to as a <b>primary marketplace</b> since shares are presented to the public for the very first time.
          The issuing company hires big <b>investment banks</b> to aid with regulatory requirements, company valuation,  as well as the sale and distribution of shares.
          The primary market is predominantly made up of <b>institutional buyers</b> who have enough buying power(money) to purchase a large number of shares for their portfolios.
          <b>Hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds</b> and other large investment companies are all examples of institutional buyers. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are a few of the most
          renowned investment banks who have very strong relationships with large institutional buyers. This is one of the main reasons why they're picked regularly to support companies with their IPOs.
          It's almost never the case that only one investment bank
          takes on the task of selling an entire IPO. Instead, the <b>lead</b> investment bank, referred to as the <b>bookrunner</b>, is hired by the company and they will then go on to recruit a number of different banks to help them in selling portions of the total issue. In return, the smaller investment
          banks will be compensated depending on how much of the allotted shares they sell.
          </p>
          <p>
          Investment banks make money through several different methods. First and foremost, they provide <b>underwriting services</b> which means that they act as middlemen between the company and those interested in purchasing IPO shares. There are many forms of underwriting, however, the most common type is known as a <b>bought deal</b>.
          Under the conditions of a bought deal, the investment bank will actually buy the <b>IPO shares</b> at a discounted price and then try to <b>sell</b> them to their clients/connections for a <b>profit</b>. The investment banks get a discount because of the risk they take on as a result of buying the shares first.
          A lot of companies prefer bought deals since they're guaranteed a sum of money even if the investment bank isn't able to sell the shares.
          Investment banks charge an underwriting fee because of the risk they take on and for managing the entire IPO process. These fees are dependent on the size of the deal itself. Generally, it's <b>3% to 7%</b> of the <b>total gross offering</b>(share price x # of shares). A good
          rule of thumb is that the larger the total gross offering, the lower the percentage fee. Read about the worlds largest IPO <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibabaipo-fees-idUSKCN0HH1EY20140922" target="_blank">here</a>.
          Finally, the <b>advice</b> which the highly intelligent investment bankers give to their clients is most definetely not free and is another component of their compensation.
          After all the shares are sold and the investment bank's commission and fees are paid, the company is left with the remainder of the capital to use how they see best fit. This capital is not used all at once and is generally retained by the company for a long period of time.

          <h3 class='underline'>Voting Rights</h3>
          <p>
          When a company decides to IPO, there are a lot of different things that must be considered before it’s officially announced to the public.
          One of the most crucial things to take into account are <b>voting rights</b>.
          Voting rights are dependent on the <b>type</b> and <b>class</b> of share that an individual owns.
          "Normal" shares are referred to as <b>common shares</b>.
          Within the category of common shares, companies can choose to issue different <b>classes</b> of common shares with the primary difference being the voting rights.
          Although, different companies can assign different classes with different voting rights, the structure discussed further is the most common.
          The shares with the highest amount of voting rights are given to the company’s management team.
          These shares are often referred to as <b>Class B</b> shares and hold a voting ratio of <b>5:1</b>(5 votes for every 1 share).
          For the IPO, a company will issue shares that have a voting ratio of <b>1:1</b> and are usually referred to as <b>Class A</b> shares. Common shares that have <b>no voting rights</b> can also be issued and these are called <b>Class C</b> shares.
          Voting rights are primarily exercised during <b>shareholder meetings</b>, which is where a variety of topics concerning the company are discussed.
          A shareholder’s most important responsibility is to <b>elect</b> the board members of a company. They’re the group of people that supervise company operations and voice any shareholder concerns during the shareholder meetings.
          Common shareholders are generally participating in decisions concering the <b>company’s future, any structural changes, dividends, stock-splits etc</b>.

          </p>

          <h3 class='underline'>Secondary Markets</h3>

          <p>
            Following an IPO, shares of the company are accessible to the rest of the public through <b>secondary markets</b>.
            The <b>Toronto</b> and <b>New York stock exchanges</b> are examples of these secondary markets. Their hours span from 9:30am to 4pm ET.
            Stocks that are listed on these exchanges regularly <b>fluctuate</b> in price because of countless external factors that influence the <b>supply</b> and <b>demand</b> of shares. Here is a video about some of these <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp" target="_blank">factors</a>.
            If a company is listed, a certain class and/or type of share now has an explicit <b>price tag</b> on it. These shares can be bought and sold by any investor on the market.
            Remember those VC and PE firms that
            invested in the company back when it was first gaining some traction? Well, they've been waiting for the company to IPO since the beginning because what was once a relatively small investment for them, is worth in some cases, <b>1000</b> times that after an IPO.
            Read about the VC firm that invested in Facebook in its early days and how their initial investment worked out for them when Facebook decided to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204573704577186813800414598 target="_blank"">IPO</a>.

          </p>
          <p>
             Investors on the secondary markets consist of buyers and sellers. Buyers submit a <b>bid</b> price, what they’re willing to <b>pay</b> for a share and sellers submit an <b>ask</b> price, what they’re willing to <b>sell</b> a share for.
             In the secondary market, the bid and ask price must <b>match</b> otherwise the trade will not be executed.
             There are thousands of transactions occurring every second on an exchange so it’s crucial that buyers and sellers can execute their trades  quickly.
             The entire process of entering and exiting the market is fully <b>computerized</b> which results in an efficient marketplace that benefits both parties.
             Unlike in the primary market, the company of the stock and investment bank generally <b>gain nothing</b> from transactions in the secondary marketplace.
             Money is simply exchanged for shares between the buyer and seller.

                  <p>
                  ABC Corporation, a popular tech startup has decided to IPO. At the moment they have issued <b>12 million Class A</b> shares within the company which are held by <b>founders</b>, <b>early employees</b> and select <b>private investors</b>.
                  <b>XYZ Group</b> is hired to assist with the IPO and and agrees to buy <b>1 million Class A</b> shares at a discounted price of $8 per share. They also take <b>3%</b> of the total gross offering in underwriting fees.
                  XYZ Group manages to sell the 1 million shares of ABC to various institutional investors at a price of<b>$9</b> per share.
                  The total sale of all these shares results in <b>$9,000,000</b>, with XYZ group making <b>$1,000,000</b> in profits alone. The underwriting fee is <b>$240,000</b>, which means that XYZ Group takes home <b>$1,240,000</b> while ABC Corporation is left with <b>$7,760,000</b>.
                  Following the IPO, ABC shares are listed on the TSX and because of strong investor <b>demand</b> the price of ABC stock opens at $20.
                  At the open, all <b>13 million </b>shares of ABC that are in circulation are worth <b>$20</b> per share.

                      <h3 class='underline'>Dividends</h3>
                      <p>
                      Dividends are a major reason why an investor might choose company A over company B.  A dividend is a cash payment that is directly tied to the number or class of shares that an individual possesses.
                      Companies who are known to regularly issue dividends are highly sought out by investors who desire a steady flow of income.
                      A dividend is given to shareholders by the company as a token of their appreciation for investing in them.
                      When a company declares a dividend, they always announce two major dates, the date of record and the date of payment.
                      The date of record is when a company checks which shareholders are eligible for the dividend.
                      This date is generally set a couple of weeks prior to the date of payment to ensure that shares aren’t being bought days in advance solely for the dividend.
                      The date of payment is when the company will start the process of releasing dividends to their shareholders.
                      Dividends can be distributed once, quarterly, semi-annually or even annually. Some companies have a set schedule for dividends and for others it’s more sporadic.
                      Dividends are usually below $1 per share and can range as high as $2-$3.
                      If a company doesn't choose to declare dividends it doesn't mean they’re doing poorly or don’t care about their investors.
                      For example, newer companies generally don’t distribute dividends because they prefer reinvesting their profits back into the business.
                      </p>

                      <h3 class='underline'>D.R.I.P</h3>

                      <p>It’s common for a company to offer their shareholders a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
                        This diverts whatever amount of money that a shareholder would’ve received from dividends back into more shares of the company.
                        These are shares which the company has bought from the open market or is holding in their treasury for future use.
                        Since shares for the D.R.I.P are coming directly from the company, they tend to sell them to current shareholders at a slightly discounted price.
                        Companies do this to incentivise customers into buying more shares and putting more money back into the company.
                        A lot of individuals opt for a D.R.I.P because it allows investors to dollar-cost average. This just means that in the long run, investors are able to grow their position size(number of shares they own) at a lower cost, providing them with a bigger gain when it comes time to sell.
                       </p>




                    <h3 class='underline'>Capital Gain/Loss</h3>
                    <p>
                    Common shareholders are obliged to participate in a company's wins and losses.
                    All this means is that as the price of a stock fluctuates, so does the value of the shares held by an investor.
                    A capital gain occurs when a share is sold for higher than what it was bought for.
                    A capital loss occurs when a share is sold for lower than what it was bought for.
                    A capital gain or loss is only realized once the position has been closed and the gain/loss is reflected in the account.
                    Up until then, the capital gain/loss is said to be unrealized. The possibility of capital gain is what makes investing in common shares so attractive.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    NOTE: The costs associated with trading such as commissions and brokerage fees must be taken into account when calculating a capital gain/loss.
                    The Adjusted Cost Base(ACB) is the method used to factor these costs in. Learn more about it <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/calculating-adjusted-cost-base-6285">here</a>.

          <h3 class='underline'>Going Long</h3>
          <p>
           A long position consists of buying shares with the belief that they will eventually increase in price.
           Generally, the price of a stock increases if there are more potential buyers than there are sellers in the market.
           Each buyer is willing to pay a higher price per share because there is only a limited supply.
           In order to close out a long position, shares are simply sold to another investor on the secondary market and a capital gain/loss is realized.
           </p>





          <h3 class='underline'>Going Short</h3>

          <p>
            There are always going to be periods where a stock is falling or trending downwards and this is where short-selling can be very useful.
            Short selling or shorting a stock means betting against it and hoping it decreases in price.
            Generally, the price of a stock decreases if there are more sellers than buyers in the market.
            Buyers know that sellers are desperate to get rid of their shares and because of this, are able to put downwards pressure on the price.
            The first step of shorting a stock is borrowing shares from someone called a broker.
            A broker is a person or firm that has access to a large inventory of shares from most companies.
            The borrower is obligated to return those shares to the broker at some point in the future but in the meantime, they’re sold to another investor on the secondary market and a short position is created.
            All the proceeds from the short sale are deposited into the trader’s account.
            Covering a short position is when shares are bought from the open market and subsequently returned to the broker.
            If the stock price decreases and the position is covered, a capital gain is realized.
            However, if the stock price increases and the position is covered, a capital loss is realized.
            The downside of short selling is that there’s unlimited risk involved. No matter how high the price of a stock is, an investor is obligated to return the original number of shares borrowed back to the broker in order to meet their end of the agreement.

          <h3 class='underline'>Taxes</h3>
          <p>
           In Canada there are two main branches of income tax, federal and provincial.
           Canada uses a progressive tax system which means that the amount of tax someone owes is proportional to how much they make.
           A person who earns $80,000 will pay more in taxes than someone who earns $50,000.
           Tax brackets were made for both federal and provincial taxes and are segregated through increasing levels of income which are taxed at increasingly higher rates.
           Find the tax rates for the 2021 year <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html">here</a>.
           </p>

          <p>
          An individual’s marginal tax rate is the highest rate at which an additional dollar of income is taxed at and in most cases, is the rate at which a person’s last dollar of income is taxed at.
          Since there are two layers of taxes in Canada, in most cases, an individual’s marginal tax rate is just the sum of the two separate marginal rates.
          However, higher tax brackets unlock a new type of tax, surtax, which is tax based on the amount of provincial tax owed.
          For simplicity, marginal tax rate will solely be the sum of federal and provincial marginal rates.
          It’s important to understand marginal tax rates because an individual might want to consider the tax consequences of earning additional income.
          For some people, earning more will cause them to move up into a higher tax bracket and most of the additional income might be lost to taxes.
          Average tax is simply the amount of tax($) divided by total income

    <h3 class='underline GTSI'>Taxation of Investment Income</h3>


        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <h6 class = "underline">Capital Gains/Losses</h6>
            <p class="">
            In Canada, 50% of all capital gains an investor makes has be reported as income.
            For example, in 2020, Monica made $80,000 from her job and $400 worth of capital gains.
            When it comes time to file taxes, Monica reports $200 of capital gains as income,
            which would in turn raise her taxable income to $80,200 for that year.
            From there, Monica would pay her provincial and federal tax just as she would’ve if there were no capital gains.
            A common misconception about capital gains are that they’re taxed AT 50%, so you’re required to give up half your capital gain in taxes.
            This is not true, the amount of tax an individual pays on their capital gains is entirely dependent on their marginal tax rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for capital losses, they’re responsible for reducing capital gains and even taxable income.
              Let’s say that Monica made $400 but also suffered $200 in capital losses.
              She is left with a net capital gain and must report 50% of it as income when she files her taxes.
              If left with a capital loss, Monica could report 50% of it as a loss and reduce her taxable income.
              The only exception to doing this, is the thirty day rule which states that if a security is bought within 30 days of selling it,
              it is considered a superficial loss and cannot be used to reduce taxable income.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h6 class = "underline">Dividend Income </h6>
            <p class='guide'>
              The taxation of dividend income, similar to capital gains, relies heavily on an individual’s marginal tax rate.
              Taxing dividends is a rather complicated procedure with a lot of tedious  calculations. Get a brief overview of the process <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/the-federal-dividend-tax-credit-in-canada-332">here</a>.
              One of the main concepts around the taxation of dividend income is the idea of eligible and non-eligible dividends. Whether a dividend is eligible or not is completely dependent
              on a company's structure and tax liabilities. Since dividend income is paid out of a company's retained earnings account, an account that holds income that has undergone taxation, there is a tax credit provided to the investors who recieve these dividends. A tax credit is a dollar amount that reduces the amount of taxes
              an individual owes. For example, if Jeffrey owes $5,000 in taxes but has a dividend tax credit of $500, he would only owe $4500.
              Essentially, dividends that come from Canadian corporations will provide higher dividend tax credits so both the corporation and investor don't end up paying tax on the same amount. Smaller businesses issue dividends that are classified as non-eligible, which means that the business itself  doesn't get taxed too harshly and this results in a smaller dividend tax credit.
              Another caveat of the dividend tax credit is that the company must be Canadian and the investor recieving the dividend has to be a Canadian resident. Dividends from foreign companies are taxed as interest income and don't provide any tax credits.
              provide tax credits as a result of how dividends are taxed in Canada.

            <h6 class = "underline">Interest Income</h6>
            <p class='guide'>
              The income that’s received from bonds or other fixed income securities is classified as interest income and the full amount is taxed like employment income(regular income).
               Unlike dividends or capital gains, interest income has a very simple taxation structure with not too many exceptions.

    <h3 class='underline GTSI'>Types of Accounts</h3>


        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <p>Buying and selling financial securities are usually done through a brokerage account.
              There are online brokerages that are offered by third party firms and major banks.
              However, before buying and selling shares using an online brokerage, an investor must decide which account is best for holding different securities in.
              There is an array of different accounts to that were created for different people that have different goals.
              Most of the special accounts that hold securities are set up with an overarching goal of providing some sort of tax benefit to its holder.
            </p>
            <h6 class = "underline">TFSA</h6>
            <p class='guide'>
            A Tax Free Savings Account is an account that doesn’t require the holder to pay taxes on any capital gains, interest income,
            or dividends that accrue as a result of the investments held within the account. To qualify for a TFSA,
            the holder must be a Canadian resident that’s 18 or above and have a valid SIN number. There is an annual
            maximum contribution for a TFSA which varies from year to year; In 2020 the maximum contribution room was $6000.
            The advantage of a TFSA is that any unused contribution room at the end of a year carries forward to future years.
              </p>
            <p>
      Example: Sam turns 18 in 2020 and decides to open a TFSA.  He contributes a total of $1000 by the end of the calendar year and has $5000 of unused contribution room.
      In 2021, the pre-set maximum contribution is $6000 but Sam’s maximum limit is $11,000 since the $5000 of unused contribution room in 2020 carries over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over contributing to a TFSA is one of the most common mistakes made by account holders because many of them aren’t aware of the rules surrounding withdrawals from the account. The limit for the contribution room outlines the total amount of funds that can be transferred into the account in a single calendar year. Withdrawals from the account do not free up contribution room, therefore, once the maximum contribution amount is reached, the holder must wait until the next calendar year in order to contribute anything. Over contributions result in a fine of 1% on the excess amount and must be paid monthly until the excess is removed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example: Sam maxes out his TFSA by contributing $6000 in July of 2020 but in August he withdraws $1000 because his car breaks down. The mechanic only needs $500 so Sam decides to put the remaining $500 back into his TFSA. In the eyes of the Canadian Revenue Agency(CRA), Sam has exceeded his maximum contribution limit for 2020 by $500. Since there is an excess of $500 in his TFSA, Sam has to pay a monthly fine of $5 until the $500 is taken out.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="">
            <h6 class = "underline">RRSP</h6>
            <p class='guide'>
  A Registered Retirement Savings Plan allows all financial securities that are held within the plan to grow tax-free. An RRSP is used in order to save funds which are meant to be utilized throughout the plan holder’s retirement period. The maximum contribution of an RRSP is 18% of the holder’s previous year’s reported income or the limit put in place by the federal government. The smaller of the two options become the maximum contribution for that year. Similar to a TFSA, unused contribution space does carry over into future years so maximum contributions differ from person to person.
              </p>
              <p>Example: Judy is trying to determine her RRSP contribution limit for 2020. She has $12,000 in unused contribution space from 2015 and 2016. The federal limit in place in 2020 is $29,835 and Judy’s pre-tax income for 2019 was $80,000. 18% of $80,000 is $14,400, since it’s the lowest of the two amounts, she adds $12,000 of unused room to reach a maximum contribution limit of $24,400 for 2020. </p>
             <p>
               The advantage of RRSPs are that all contributions are tax deductible, which means that they reduce the holder’s of taxable income. For example, If Judy made $100,000 in 2019 but contributed $14,400 in the same year, she would only be required to pay taxes on $85,600. If an individual decides to withdraw from an RRSP before it reaches maturity (age 71) , the funds are first subject to a withdrawal tax based on the amount taken out and are also taxed again as regular income for that year. Look at the options for when the plan reaches maturity <a href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/products/saving-investing/registered-plans/rsp/rrsp-withdrawal-rules/">here</a>. Besides the withdrawal tax, the rules around TFSA withdrawals and RRSP withdrawals are identical. Once funds are withdrawn, that contribution room is permanently lost and the plan holder is not able to deposit funds if their maximum amount for that calendar year has already been reached.  As for over contributions, up to $2000 is allowed without a fine but that amount is not tax deductible. Over contributions for RRSPs past the $2000 mark are subject to the same fine structure as a TFSA.

An RESP is used by parents to save and invest capital for their children’s post-secondary education. Unlike an RRSP, contributions to a RESP are not tax deductible and the plan itself has a lifetime contribution limit of $50,000. The holder of the plan is usually a parent/guardian who makes the contributions and names one or more of their children as beneficiaries. A beneficiary is the person(s) who will end up using the funds. The beneficiary does not have to meet an age requirement in order for the parent/guardian to make a RESP but in order for the funds to be withdrawn, the plan has to be in existence for at least 10 years.
A parent can start investing in a RESP when their child is 8 years old and would have access to the funds when the child is 18.
Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate, which is very advantageous since in most cases,
they’ll be in a lower tax bracket then the plan holder. Since they’re in a lower tax bracket, they won’t have to pay too much in taxes and the majority of funds can
be put towards their education. Funds can only be transferred out of the plan if the beneficiary is older than 21 and has decided not to pursue further education or all
the named beneficiaries have died.
