          <h3 class='underline'>Private to Public</h3>
          <p>
            A private company refers to a business that is independently owned by a relatively small group of investors. There are many forms of private companies, however, most choose to identify as c-corporations. As a c-corporation, ownership and control are divided into small pieces known as shares. There’s no restriction on the number of shares that may exist within a c-corporation, but when and to whom shares are issued is usually up to the discretion of the company’s executives. Generally, shares are allocated to the company’s management team, private investors and employees. Shares within a privately held corporation have an implicit value, meaning that the price of a share is not public knowledge and actually requires someone to find its value. One of the downsides of owning private shares is that they’re only transferrable upon the approval of the management team; They want to ensure that the shares are being put in the right hands and being given to investors who're interested in the company's growth. A private company's main funding comes from the revenue they make, but a big amount is coming from private investors through  When a privately held company reaches a certain point, the cost to maintain and expand the business outgrows their pockets. In order for the business to continue its growth, pay off outstanding debt or fund new ventures, a larger than usual sum of capital is required. One of the many ways a company can raise this capital is through an Initial Public Offering(IPO). When a company IPO’s, they give the public an opportunity to buy newly issued shares directly from them.
          </p>
          <h3 class='underline'>Primary Market</h3>

          <p>
            An IPO is referred to as a primary marketplace since shares are presented to the public for the very first time. The issuing company hires big investment banks to aid with regulatory requirements, company valuation, and the sale and distribution of shares. Goldman Sachs, J.P Morgan and Barclays are a few of the most renowned investment banks that are picked regularly to support firms with their IPOs. The primary market is predominantly made up of institutional buyers who have enough buying
            power(money) to purchase a large sum of shares for their portfolios(collection of financial securities). Hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds, and other large investment companies are all examples of institutional buyers. An example of one of the biggest institutional buyers is BlackRock Fund Advisors, owning over 700 million shares of Apple , valued at over 96 billion dollars. Investment banks can work with the company to set the IPO price or go through the book building process. Book
            building is the process by which an investment bank collects bids by investors who are interested in the IPO, giving them a sense of investor interest and what a fair issue price would be. Investment banks make some of their money through the advisory services they provide, but make most of their profit by taking a percentage of all shares sold in the primary market. All proceeds from transactions in the primary marketplace with the exception of fees and commissions, go directly to the company
            to use however they see best fit.
          </p>
          <h3 class='underline'>Secondary Market</h3>
          <p>
            Following an IPO, shares of the company are accessible to the rest of the public through secondary markets. The Toronto and New York stock exchanges are examples of recognized secondary markets. Shares that trade on these exchanges regularly fluctuate in price because of countless external factors that influence the supply and demand of the shares. Investors on the secondary markets can be buyers or sellers. Buyers submit a bid price, what they’re willing to pay for the share and sellers submit an ask price, what they’re willing to sell the share for. In the secondary market, the bid and ask price must match otherwise the trade will not be executed. There are thousands of transactions occurring every second on an exchange, so it’s essential that buyers and sellers are able to execute trades quickly. The entire process of entering and exiting the market is fully computerized, resulting in an efficient marketplace which benefits both parties. Unlike in the primary market, the company of the stock nor the investment bank gain anything from transactions in the secondary marketplace; Money is simply exchanged for shares between the buyer and seller.
          </p>
          <h4 class='underline'>Example</h3>
            <p>
              ABC Corp, a privately held company, has decided to IPO. At the moment they have issued 1.1 million class A shares within the company which they have distributed to employees, private investors and executives. XYZ Group, an investment bank, is hired to assist with the IPO and agrees to a commission of 5% on every share sold in the primary market. XYZ Group and ABC Corp decide on an IPO price of $10 a share; 1 million class A shares are subsequently issued and sold. The total sale of all these shares results in $10,000,000, with XYZ group making $500,000 of commissions and ABC Corp making a net total of $9,500,000. The day after the IPO, shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and because of strong demand, the price of ABC stock opens at $20. At the open, all 2.2 million shares of ABC that are in circulation are worth $20 per share.

            When a company reaches a certain point, the cost to maintain and expand the business <b>outgrows</b> their pockets.
            In order for the business to continue it's growth and fund any new ventures, <b>additional capital</b> is required.
            A company can raise this capital in a number of different ways, one of which is through an <b>IPO(Initial Public Offering)</b>.
            When a company IPO's, they are essentially giving the public the opportunity to buy a <b>fraction</b> of their company for a particular <b>price</b> directly from them.
            That fraction of ownership is referred to as a <b>share</b> and the individual that owns it, the <b>shareholder</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            An IPO is an example of a <b>primary market</b>, a place where never before traded shares are bought.
            When bought, the proceeds from these shares go directly to the <b>company</b> and are utilized however they see best fit.
            What's most common is that very <b>large clients</b> buy chunks of the IPO directly from the company and sell them to investors in the <b>secondary market</b> for a profit.
            The secondary market is a place where shares that have been issued are traded among investors.
            The <b>Toronto and NewYork Stock Exchanges </b>are examples of secondary markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shares that trade on these exhanges fluctuate in price every second due to countless external factors that influence the <b>supply and demand</b> of the share.
            Investors can be buyers or sellers; Buyers submit a bid price, which is what they're willing to pay for the share and sellers submit an ask price, what they're willing to sell the share for.
            In the secondary market, the bid and ask price must <b>match</b>, otherwise the trade will not be executed.
            Depending on the stock, there are <b>thousands</b> of transactions happening every second and humans are not capable of keeping track of orders and matching buyers to sellers effectively.
            Thankfully, this matching process was <b>computerized</b> and buyers and sellers could enter and exit the market very quickly. This resulted in an effecient marketplace that benefitted everyone.
            Unlike in the primary market, the company of the stock doesn't gain anything from transactions in the secondary marketplace, money is simply moved from the <b>buyer</b> to the <b>seller</b>.

          <h3 class='underline'>Going Long</h3>
          <p>“Buy low, sell high”, a very well known phrase which is essentially the underlying principle behind the traditional way of making money on the stock market. What ‘going long’ entails is investing in a company for the long run. When you
            enter into a long position, you would buy shares of a company and have full ownership of those shares. From there, you would hope that the stock price increases, if or when it does, you would then sell those shares to another investor and
            realize a capital gain. But say if the stock price goes down, your shares would now be worth a lot less than before. Investors would be willing to buy them for a reduced price which would ultimately result in a capital loss.
          </p>
          <p>Example: Arjun buys 20 shares of ABC at $2 a share. His account would reflect a defecit of $40 at that point. From there, ABC stock rises to 4$ a share and Arjun decides to sell his shares to another investor. From this sale he would
            receive $80, leaving him with a gain of $40. Now let’s say the stock falls to $1. Arjun decides to cut his losses and sell his shares to another investor, from this transaction he would only receive $20, leaving him with a $20 deficit.
          </p>

          <h3 class='underline'>Going Short</h3>

          <p>Prices aren’t always going up though, inevitably there are going to be periods where a stock falls or is trending downwards, so what kind of trade could you place then, or do you just wait it out? Well, you can’t go long because when it
            comes time to sell, you aren’t going to be left with a profit. This is where short-selling really comes in handy. When you short sell or short a stock, you are betting against it. You are hoping that the stock goes down so you can
            capitalize on it. It seems weird right? I can make money when a stock goes down? Yes, when you short a stock, you borrow shares from someone called a broker. A broker is a person or company that has a large inventory of shares from most
            companies. You promise to return those shares to the broker at a later date but in the meantime you sell them to another investor on the open market, creating a short position. All the proceeds from the short sale are deposited into your
            account. If the stock price decreases, you will cover your short position by buying shares back at a lower price and returning them to your broker. However, the downside of short selling is that there’s unlimited risk involved. A stock
            can
            decide to soar after you short it and you have to buy it regardless of the price as you must return those shares to your broker at some point.</p>
          <p>Example: Natalie short sells 10 shares of XYZ at $5. She would receive 50$ in her account but she still has to return 10 shares back to her broker. When the stock price goes down to $4, she decides to cover her position by buying 10
            shares
            of XYZ and returning them to her broker. It only cost her $40 to buy those shares so in her account, there’s a capital gain of $10. Let’s say instead of going down to $4, the price actually goes up to $6. Well, Natalie only had 50$ from
            the
            initial short sale, she now has to buy 10 shares of XYZ at $6 in order to return them to her broker. This transaction would leave her with a deficit of 10$. </p>

          <h3 class='underline'>Voting Rights
          </h3>
          <p>When a company decides to IPO, there’s a lot of different things that have to be taken into consideration before it’s officially announced to the public. One of the most crucial things to take into account are voting rights. When a
            company
            IPOs, shares are split between two main groups of people, large institutional investors and company executives. Institutional investors are just large groups of investors with a lot of buying power, like mutual fund companies, hedge funds
            etc. They take up a good majority of shares as they are hoping to keep a portion of shares for the long term and sell some shares off in the secondary market. Then there’s the company executives, the CEO’s and other higher ups who retain
            a
            good portion of shares. Voting rights rely on the type and class of share that an individual owns. Regular shares are referred to as common shares. Within the category of common shares, companies can choose to issue class A, B or C common
            shares, the primary difference being the voting rights. Class A shares could have a 5:1 ratio, for every share you have, you would get 5 voting rights. Class B shares could have a 1:1 voting rights. Class A shares are reserved for those
            large institutional investors and company executives so they can prioritize shareholder’s wants while still having the final say in important decisions. Every common shareholder is given voting rights which are utilized in shareholder
            meetings held by companies. Common shareholder’s most important responsibility is to elect the board members of a company. They’re the group of people that supervise company operations while also representing and advocate for the
            interests
            of the shareholders. Common shareholders can also vote for company goals and structural changes. Votes from small investors aren’t going to have that big of an impact in a company’s final decision, voting is just a way for the board of
            directors to appease shareholders and take their considerations when making final decisions.

              This allows your broker to hold you accountable for any losses that you incur and makes you liable for whatever the consequences are as a result.
              However, if you’re not 18 you can also open what’s known as a custodial account which allows you to have a personal account that’s funded and supervised by a parent/legal guardian.
