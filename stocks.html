        <h3>Stock Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>
          When a company reaches a certain point, the cost to maintain and expand the business <b>outgrows</b> their pockets.
          In order for the business to continue it's growth and fund any new ventures, <b>additional capital</b> is required.
          A company can raise this capital in a number of different ways, one of which is through an <b>IPO(Initial Public Offering)</b>.
          When a company IPO's, they are essentially giving the public the opportunity to buy a <b>fraction</b> of their company for a particular <b>price</b> directly from them.
          That fraction of ownership is referred to as a <b>share</b> and the individual that owns it, the <b>shareholder</b>.
          An IPO is an example of a <b>primary market</b>, a place where never before traded shares are bought.
          When bought, the proceeds from these shares go directly to the <b>company</b> and are utilized however they see best fit.
          What's most common is that very <b>large clients</b> buy chunks of the IPO directly from the company and sell them to investors in the <b>secondary market</b> for a profit.
          The secondary market is a place where shares that have been issued are traded among investors.
          The <b>Toronto and NewYork Stock Exchanges </b>are examples of secondary markets.
          Shares that trade on these exhanges fluctuate in price every second due to countless external factors that influence the <b>supply and demand</b> of the share.
          Investors can be buyers or sellers; Buyers submit a bid price, which is what they're willing to pay for the share and sellers submit an ask price, what they're willing to sell the share for.
          In the secondary market, the bid and ask price must <b>match</b>, otherwise the trade will not be executed.
          Depending on the stock, there are <b>thousands</b> of transactions happening every second and humans are not capable of keeping track of orders and matching buyers to sellers effectively.
          Thankfully, this matching process was <b>computerized</b> and buyers and sellers could enter and exit the market very quickly. This resulted in an effecient marketplace that benefitted everyone.
          Unlike in the primary market, the company of the stock doesn't gain anything from transactions in the secondary marketplace, money is simply moved from the <b>buyer</b> to the <b>seller</b>.

        <h3>What's the point?</h3>
        <p>
          We already discussed the life cycle of a stock but let's dive a little bit deeper into what possessing a share really means.
          As a shareholder, you are <b>obliged</b> to participate in a company's <b>wins</b> and <b>losses</b>. The <b>value</b> of stocks is constantly <b>fluctuating</b> and it is up to you to decide when to <b>enter</b> and <b>exit</b> the market.
          Traditionally, if you <b>sell</b> a share when the price is <b>higher</b> than when you first bought it, you would realize a <b>capital gain</b>(profit).
          Looking at it from the other side, if you <b>sell</b>  a share when the price is <b>lower</b> than when you first bought it, you would realize a <b>capital loss</b>(defecit).
          The possibility of capital gain is what makes investing in stocks so <b>attractive</b> to investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy shares of a company, you'll most probably only see that money when you decide to <b>sell</b>. Even then, there's no guarantee that you'll realize a profit so you're basically just left waiting.
          However, a company can also decide to declare something called <b>dividends</b>.
          A dividend is a <b>cash payment</b> that a company can choose distribute to it's <b>shareholders</b>. It acts as a token of <b>appreciation</b> in return for the contributions made by investors.
          Dividends are usually paid out on a <b>per-share</b> basis and can be distributed only <b>once</b>, <b>quarterly</b>, <b>semi-annually</b> or even <b>annually</b>.
          For example, company XYZ declares a dividend for <b>$3 per-share</b>. If I owned <b>10</b> shares at the time of the announcement, I would recieve <b>$30</b>.
          Investors who desire a <b>steady flow</b> of income are drawn to companies who have a history of regularly issuing dividends to it's shareholders.
          It's a pretty sweet deal; Your shares can be increasing in value all the while you're still recieving regular cash payments
          If a company doesn't choose to give out dividends it doesn't necessarily mean it's not stable or doesn't care for it's investors.
          A lot of the times, the company decides it's best to <b>reinvest</b> their profits back into the business to become even bigger.
          This could result in higher earnings for the company and the stock performing better, providing you with a higher return.
