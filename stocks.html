        <h3 class = 'underline'>Stock Life Cycle <hr> </h3>
        <p>
          When a company reaches a certain point, the cost to maintain and expand the business <b>outgrows</b> their pockets.
          In order for the business to continue it's growth and fund any new ventures, <b>additional capital</b> is required.
          A company can raise this capital in a number of different ways, one of which is through an <b>IPO(Initial Public Offering)</b>.
          When a company IPO's, they are essentially giving the public the opportunity to buy a <b>fraction</b> of their company for a particular <b>price</b> directly from them.
          That fraction of ownership is referred to as a <b>share</b> and the individual that owns it, the <b>shareholder</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
          An IPO is an example of a <b>primary market</b>, a place where never before traded shares are bought.
          When bought, the proceeds from these shares go directly to the <b>company</b> and are utilized however they see best fit.
          What's most common is that very <b>large clients</b> buy chunks of the IPO directly from the company and sell them to investors in the <b>secondary market</b> for a profit.
          The secondary market is a place where shares that have been issued are traded among investors.
          The <b>Toronto and NewYork Stock Exchanges </b>are examples of secondary markets.
          </p>
          <p>
          Shares that trade on these exhanges fluctuate in price every second due to countless external factors that influence the <b>supply and demand</b> of the share.
          Investors can be buyers or sellers; Buyers submit a bid price, which is what they're willing to pay for the share and sellers submit an ask price, what they're willing to sell the share for.
          In the secondary market, the bid and ask price must <b>match</b>, otherwise the trade will not be executed.
          Depending on the stock, there are <b>thousands</b> of transactions happening every second and humans are not capable of keeping track of orders and matching buyers to sellers effectively.
          Thankfully, this matching process was <b>computerized</b> and buyers and sellers could enter and exit the market very quickly. This resulted in an effecient marketplace that benefitted everyone.
          Unlike in the primary market, the company of the stock doesn't gain anything from transactions in the secondary marketplace, money is simply moved from the <b>buyer</b> to the <b>seller</b>.

        <h3 class = 'underline'>What's the point? <hr> </h3>
        <p>
          We already discussed the life cycle of a stock but let's dive a little bit deeper into what possessing a share really means.
          As a shareholder, you are <b>obliged</b> to participate in a company's <b>wins</b> and <b>losses</b>. The <b>value</b> of stocks is constantly <b>fluctuating</b> and it is up to you to decide when to <b>enter</b> and <b>exit</b> the market.
          Traditionally, if you <b>sell</b> a share when the price is <b>higher</b> than when you first bought it, you would realize a <b>capital gain</b>(profit).
          Looking at it from the other side, if you <b>sell</b>  a share when the price is <b>lower</b> than when you first bought it, you would realize a <b>capital loss</b>(defecit).
          The possibility of capital gain is what makes investing in stocks so <b>attractive</b> to investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy shares of a company, you'll most probably only see that money when you decide to <b>sell</b>. Even then, there's no guarantee that you'll realize a profit so you're basically just left waiting.
          However, a company can also decide to declare something called <b>dividends</b>.
          A dividend is a <b>cash payment</b> that a company can choose distribute to it's <b>shareholders</b>. It acts as a token of <b>appreciation</b> in return for the contributions made by investors.
          Dividends are usually paid out on a <b>per-share</b> basis and can be distributed only <b>once</b>, <b>quarterly</b>, <b>semi-annually</b> or even <b>annually</b>.
          For example, company XYZ declares a dividend for <b>$3 per-share</b>. If I owned <b>10</b> shares at the time of the announcement, I would recieve <b>$30</b>.
          Investors who desire a <b>steady flow</b> of income are drawn to companies who have a history of regularly issuing dividends to it's shareholders.
          It's a pretty sweet deal; Your shares can be increasing in value all the while you're still recieving regular cash payments
          If a company doesn't choose to give out dividends it doesn't necessarily mean it's not stable or doesn't care for it's investors.
          A lot of the times, the company decides it's best to <b>reinvest</b> their profits back into the business to become even bigger.
          This could result in higher earnings for the company and the stock performing better, providing you with a higher return.

          <h3 class = 'underline'>Going Long <hr> </h3>
        <p>“Buy low, sell high”, a very well known phrase which is essentially the underlying principle behind the traditional way of making money on the stock market. What ‘going long’ entails is investing in a company for the long run. When you
          enter into a long position, you would buy shares of a company and have full ownership of those shares. From there, you would hope that the stock price increases, if or when it does, you would then sell those shares to another investor and
          realize a capital gain. But say if the stock price goes down, your shares would now be worth a lot less than before. Investors would be willing to buy them for a reduced price which would ultimately result in a capital loss.
        </p>
        <p>Example: Arjun buys 20 shares of ABC at $2 a share. His account would reflect a defecit of $40 at that point. From there, ABC stock rises to 4$ a share and Arjun decides to sell his shares to another investor. From this sale he would
          receive $80, leaving him with a gain of $40. Now let’s say the stock falls to $1. Arjun decides to cut his losses and sell his shares to another investor, from this transaction he would only receive $20, leaving him with a $20 deficit.</p>

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Going Short <hr> </h3>

        <p>Prices aren’t always going up though, inevitably there are going to be periods where a stock falls or is trending downwards, so what kind of trade could you place then, or do you just wait it out? Well, you can’t go long because when it
          comes time to sell, you aren’t going to be left with a profit. This is where short-selling really comes in handy. When you short sell or short a stock, you are betting against it. You are hoping that the stock goes down so you can
          capitalize on it. It seems weird right? I can make money when a stock goes down? Yes, when you short a stock, you borrow shares from someone called a broker. A broker is a person or company that has a large inventory of shares from most
          companies. You promise to return those shares to the broker at a later date but in the meantime you sell them to another investor on the open market, creating a short position. All the proceeds from the short sale are deposited into your
          account. If the stock price decreases, you will cover your short position by buying shares back at a lower price and returning them to your broker. However, the downside of short selling is that there’s unlimited risk involved. A stock can
          decide to soar after you short it and you have to buy it regardless of the price as you must return those shares to your broker at some point.</p>
        <p>Example: Natalie short sells 10 shares of XYZ at $5. She would receive 50$ in her account but she still has to return 10 shares back to her broker. When the stock price goes down to $4, she decides to cover her position by buying 10 shares
          of XYZ and returning them to her broker. It only cost her $40 to buy those shares so in her account, there’s a capital gain of $10. Let’s say instead of going down to $4, the price actually goes up to $6. Well, Natalie only had 50$ from the
          initial short sale, she now has to buy 10 shares of XYZ at $6 in order to return them to her broker. This transaction would leave her with a deficit of 10$. </p>

        <h3 class='underline'>Voting Rights
          <hr>
        </h3>
        <p>When a company decides to IPO, there’s a lot of different things that have to be taken into consideration before it’s officially announced to the public. One of the most crucial things to take into account are voting rights. When a company
          IPOs, shares are split between two main groups of people, large institutional investors and company executives. Institutional investors are just large groups of investors with a lot of buying power, like mutual fund companies, hedge funds
          etc. They take up a good majority of shares as they are hoping to keep a portion of shares for the long term and sell some shares off in the secondary market. Then there’s the company executives, the CEO’s and other higher ups who retain a
          good portion of shares. Voting rights rely on the type and class of share that an individual owns. Regular shares are referred to as common shares. Within the category of common shares, companies can choose to issue class A, B or C common
          shares, the primary difference being the voting rights. Class A shares could have a 5:1 ratio, for every share you have, you would get 5 voting rights. Class B shares could have a 1:1 voting rights. Class A shares are reserved for those
          large institutional investors and company executives so they can prioritize shareholder’s wants while still having the final say in important decisions. Every common shareholder is given voting rights which are utilized in shareholder
          meetings held by companies. Common shareholder’s most important responsibility is to elect the board members of a company. They’re the group of people that supervise company operations while also representing and advocate for the interests
          of the shareholders. Common shareholders can also vote for company goals and structural changes. Votes from small investors aren’t going to have that big of an impact in a company’s final decision, voting is just a way for the board of
          directors to appease shareholders and take their considerations when making final decisions.

      <h3 class = 'underline'>How to Invest <hr> </h3>
      <p>Investing in the stock market can seem tricky at first but there aren't too many obstacles to overcome for the average investor.
         Here are some of the basic rules and guidelines:
      </p>
      <p>
      1) AGE: You must be 18 years old to start investing, unless you choose to invest with a parent/guardian's account
    </p>
<p>
      2) TYPE: You can either choose to use a stock broker to place trades or you can open up a self directed account and trade by yourself without any advise. Regardless of your decision
         there will be commission fees each time you decide to enter and exit the market by placing trades. If you decide to go with a broker, he can also charge you based on the percentage of the total trade value.
         </p>
         <p>
      3) HOW?: If you decide on the self directed directed account, investing through a TFSA, or Tax Free Savings Account will only work to your advantage. In Canada
         say if you make a profit off your trade, you will have to pay capital gains tax which is taxed at 50%. If you recieve any dividends, they will also be taxed. However,
         if you invest in the stock market through a TFSA, you will not have to pay tax on your capital gains or dividend payments. Additionally, all your withdrawals will also be tax free. This is a
         serious advantage and the best way to maximize your profits.
       </p>
       <p>
      4) WHERE?: Once you're 18, you can go to any bank and open up a TFSA there. Some noteworthy banks are TD, RBC and CIBC.
      There are also tons of online brokerages that offer the same types of accounts. Questrade, E-trade and RobinHood are a few of the most popular ones.
      </p>

      <p>
      5) LEARN LEARN LEARN- Investing in stocks will not make you a millionaire overnight. Investing requires a lot of patience and mental strength which is important to develop even before you start to trade with real money.
         Understanding things like your risk tolerance, how much you're willing to lose, is really important to establish early on so you don't end up with devestating losses. Investors must constantly adapt to new situations and learn along their journey, and it's just as important for you to do the same.
         really important for you
