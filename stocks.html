          <h3 class='underline'>Startup</h3>
          <p>
          A <b>startup</b> refers to an early-stage company that is in the midst of creating a product/service with the end goal of bringing it to market.
          <b>Ownership and control</b>  are divided amongst the creators and other employees via <b>shares</b> which can be thought of as very small pieces of a company.
          Generally, those who own the greatest number of shares  have the most control over what a company does and will decide to do in the future.
          Initially, the founders possess the greatest number of shares and the remaining are split between employees, advisors, etc.
          Shares are split like this in order to enable founders to sway major company decisions in their favour while keeping their employees invested in the company and excited for its future.
          The ownership of shares also outline the division of profits if a company is doing well, as well as the divison of assets upon the disolution(closing) of a company.
          </p>

          <h3 class='underline'>How startups raise capital</h3>

          <p>
          Besides ownership, one of the biggest challenges for startups and the reason why most aren’t successful is because of their <b>inability to raise enough capital</b>.
          A great deal of money is required in order to take a concept, turn it into a product/service and finally bring it to market.
          Unfortunately, startups don’t have much capital to spare because in most cases, founders, their family and friends, along with other small investors are responsible for funding the project during its very early stages.
          However, at some point or another, that money will run out and in order
          to keep the business growing, additional capital is required.
          This is where <b>Venture Capitalists</b> and <b>Private Equity Firms</b> come in; They financially support the company by providing capital as well as their guidance. However,in exchange for all of this help, they take an <b>equity stake</b> in the company. Prior to this,
          a start-up has only issued shares a small number of times. Once when the share/corporate structure was established and a few other times for early investors and employees. Once the process of raising capital is in full swing, more and more shares are subsequently <b>issued</b> in order to <b>compensate</b> those that make contributions.
          VC's make large contributions in order to acquire a relatively large percentage of a start up. Along with PE firms, their main job is to look for companies with potential, invest in them early on and hopefully have it pay off in the end when the company becomes successful.
          </p>
          <p>
          One thing to keep in mind is that shares of startups/private companies do not have a <b>price tag</b> on them.
          Potential investors will do tons of research and work with advisors in the company to come up with the company's present value at the time of the investment. The value of a startup comes down to it's <b>earning potential </b>and future revenues.
          After this is done, an investor can choose to invest a sum of money in exchange for a percentage of the company. For example, say a private investor wants to invest in startup XYZ.
          The founders and the private investor agree that the company is worth <b>$1,000,000</b>. Therefore, in exchange for <b>$200,000</b> the investor will receive <b>20%</b> of the company.
          This 20% comes in the form of shares which will then be issued in order to fairly compensate the investor for their investment. It's important to note that the since the number of shares outstanding are <b>increasing</b>, the value of each individual share is <b>decreasing</b>. To make it easier to understand
          think of a company as a pie. The actual size of the pie will never change but every time someone wants a piece of it, someone else's piece becomes smaller.
          When this happens to a company's shares/ownership, it's known as <b>dilution</b>. Watch this brief <a class ="links" href="https://youtu.be/rRGRpKGTCV0" target="_blank">video</a> to get a better idea of exactly how it works.

          <h3 class='underline'>Primary Market</h3>
          <p>
          As a startup is rapidly growing in size and gaining popularity, more and more money is required keep them on that trajectory. At some point, even the biggest VC's and PE firms are going to stop putting money into a start-up because they're not willing to take on additional risk.
          In order for the business to continue its growth, pay off outstanding debt or fund new ventures in future years, a larger than usual sum of capital is raised.
          One of the many ways a company can raise this capital is through an <b>Initial Public Offering(IPO)</b>.
          An IPO is when a company decides to give the <b>public</b> an opportunity to buy <b>newly</b> issued shares directly from them. Capital is not the sole reason why some companies decide to IPO.
          An IPO can enhance a company’s public image, give them prestige and really cement them in a given marketplace.
          </p>

          <p>
          An IPO is referred to as a <b>primary marketplace</b> since shares are presented to the public for the very first time.
          The issuing company hires big <b>investment banks</b> to aid with regulatory requirements, company valuation,  as well as the sale and distribution of shares.
          The primary market is predominantly made up of <b>institutional buyers</b> who are companies that have enough money to purchase a large number of shares for their portfolios.
          <b>Hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds</b> and other large investment companies are all examples of institutional buyers. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are a few of the most
          renowned investment banks who have very strong relationships with large institutional buyers. This is one of the main reasons why they're picked regularly to support companies with their IPOs.
          It's almost never the case that only one investment bank
          takes on the task of selling an entire IPO. Instead, the <b>lead</b> investment bank, referred to as the <b>bookrunner</b>, is hired by the company and they will then go on to recruit a number of different banks to help them in selling portions of the total issue. In return, the smaller investment
          banks will be compensated depending on how much of the allotted shares they sell.
          </p>
          <div class="centre">

          <img class = "invest-image" src="images/ipo.png" alt="">

        </div>

          <p>
          Investment banks make money through several different avenues. First and foremost, they provide <b>underwriting services</b> which means that they act as middlemen between the company and those interested in purchasing IPO shares. There are many forms of underwriting, however, the most common type is known as a <b>bought deal</b>.
          Under the conditions of a bought deal, the investment bank will actually buy the <b>IPO shares</b> at a discounted price and then try to <b>sell</b> them to their clients/connections for a <b>profit</b>. The investment banks get a discount because of the risk they take on as a result of buying the shares first.
          A lot of companies prefer bought deals since they're guaranteed a sum of money even if the investment bank isn't able to sell the shares.
          Investment banks charge an underwriting fee because of the risk they take on and for managing the entire IPO process. These fees are dependent on the size of the deal itself. Generally, it's <b>3% to 7%</b> of the <b>total gross offering</b>(share price <b>x</b> # of shares). A good
          rule of thumb is that the larger the total gross offering, the lower the percentage fee. Read about the worlds largest IPO <a class ="links" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alibabaipo-fees-idUSKCN0HH1EY20140922" target="_blank">here</a>.
          Finally, the <b>advice</b> which the highly intelligent investment bankers give to their clients is most definetely not free and is another component of their compensation.
          After all the shares are sold and the investment bank's commission and fees are paid, the company is left with the remainder of the capital to use how they see best fit. This capital is not used all at once and is generally retained by the company for a long period of time.

          <h3 class='underline'>Voting Rights</h3>
          <p>
          When a company decides to IPO, there are a lot of different terms that must be decided prior to the actual sale of shares.
          One of the most crucial things to take into account are <b>voting rights</b>. Voting rights are primarily exercised during <b>shareholder meetings</b>, which is where a variety of topics concerning the company are discussed.
          A shareholder’s most important responsibility is to <b>elect</b> the board members of a company. They’re the group of people that supervise company operations and voice any shareholder concerns during the shareholder meetings.
          Common shareholders are  participating in decisions concerning the <b>company’s future, any structural changes, dividends, stock-splits etc</b>.
          Voting rights are dependent on the <b>type</b> and <b>class</b> of share that an individual owns.
          "Normal" shares are the standard types of shares that are traded on stock exchanges and they're referred to as <b>common shares</b>.
          Within the category of common shares, different classes exist with the primary difference being the voting rights that each type holds.
          Although, different companies can assign different classes with different voting rights, the structure below is fairly common.
          <ul>
            <li class = "class-shares">  📈 <b> Class A</b> 	&nbsp<p class = "shares">These are the bulk of shares that are sold during an <b>IPO</b>. They generally hold a voting ratio of <b>1:1</b>(1 vote for every 1 share).</p></li>
            <li class = "class-shares">   📈 <b> Class B</b> 	&nbsp<p class = "shares">These are shares which are held by high level <b>executives</b> and the <b>founders</b> of the company.They hold a voting ratio higher than Class A shares, ranging from <b>5:1</b> all the way up to <b>10:1</b> and possibly even more. These shares are not traded on stock exchanges and generally only change hands between higher level employees.</p></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
<p>
  Class B shares exist as a way for company executives to retain <b>majority</b> voting power. Although class A shareholders do have the right to vote and their opinions will be taken into account, it's important for company leaders to be able to
  make the final call when making big decisions.

</p>




          <h3 class='underline'>Secondary Markets</h3>

          <p>
            Following an IPO, shares of the company are accessible to the rest of the public through <b>secondary markets</b>.
            The <b>Toronto</b> and <b>New York stock exchanges</b> are examples of these secondary markets. Their hours span from 9:30am to 4pm ET.
            Stocks that are listed on these exchanges regularly <b>fluctuate</b> in price because of countless external factors that influence the <b>supply</b> and <b>demand</b> of shares. Here is a video about some of these <a class ="links" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp" target="_blank">factors</a>.
            If a company is listed, a certain class and/or type of share now has an explicit <b>price tag</b> on it. These shares can be bought and sold by any investor on the market.
            Remember those VC and PE firms that
            invested in the company back when it was first gaining some traction? Well, they've been waiting for the company to IPO since the beginning because what was once a relatively small investment for them, is worth in some cases, <b>1000</b> times that after an IPO.
            Read about the VC firm that invested in Facebook in its early days and how their initial investment worked out for them when Facebook decided to <a class ="links" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204573704577186813800414598 target="_blank"">IPO</a>.

          </p>
          <p>
             Investors on the secondary markets consist of buyers and sellers. Buyers submit a <b>bid</b> price, what they’re willing to <b>pay</b> for a share and sellers submit an <b>ask</b> price, what they’re willing to <b>sell</b> a share for.
             In the secondary market, the bid and ask price must <b>match</b> otherwise the trade will not be executed.
             There are thousands of transactions occurring every second on an exchange so it’s crucial that buyers and sellers can execute their trades quickly.
             The entire process of entering and exiting the market is fully <b>computerized</b> which results in an efficient marketplace that benefits both parties.
             Unlike in the primary market, the company of the stock and investment bank generally <b>gain nothing</b> from transactions in the secondary marketplace.
             Money is simply exchanged for shares between the buyer and seller.

                  <b>XYZ Group</b> is hired to assist with the IPO and and agrees to buy <b>1 million Class A</b> shares at a discounted price of $8 per share. They also take 3% of the total gross offering in underwriting fees.
                  XYZ Group manages to sell the 1 million shares of ABC to various institutional investors at a price of $9 per share.
                  The total sale of all these shares results in $9,000,000, with XYZ group making $1,000,000 in profits alone. The underwriting fee is $240,000 so XYZ Group takes home $1,240,000 while ABC Corporation is left with $7,760,000.
                  Following the IPO, ABC shares are listed on the TSX and because of strong investor <b>demand</b> the price of ABC stock opens at $20.

                      <h3 class='underline'>Dividends</h3>
                      <p>
                      A dividend is a <b>cash payment</b> that is given to shareholders by the company and is generally done to show their <b>appreciation</b> for their investors. It's important to mention that dividends are given out on a <b>per share basis </b>and rely on the <b>class</b> of share that an investor owns.
                      Dividends are a major reason why an investor might choose company A over company B.
                      Companies who are known to regularly issue dividends are <b>highly sought out</b> by investors who desire a steady flow of income.
                      When a company declares a dividend, they always announce two major dates: the <b>date of record</b> and the <b>date of payment</b>.
                      The date of record is when a company checks which shareholders are <b>eligible</b> for the dividend.
                      This date is generally set a couple of weeks <b>prior</b> to the date of payment to ensure that shares aren’t being bought days in advance <b>solely</b> for the dividend.
                      The date of payment is when the company will start the process of <b>releasing dividends</b> to their shareholders.
                      Dividends can be distributed <b>once</b>, <b>quarterly</b>,<b>semi-annually</b> or even <b>annually</b>.
                      The decision to declare dividends is up to the company's <b>board of directors</b> and while some companies are capable of issuing dividends on a <b>regular basis</b>, for some it depends on the quarter/year they've had.
                      Dividends usually range from a couple <b>cents</b> all the way up to a couple <b>dollars</b>. These cents and dollars are coming from a company's <b>profits</b> and although it may seem small, those cents start to add up if you're a company like Apple and have
                      billions of shareholders to pay.
                      If a company doesn't choose to declare dividends it doesn't mean they’re doing <b>poorly</b> or don’t care about their investors.
                      For example, <b>newer</b> companies typically stray from distributing dividends because they prefer <b>reinvesting</b> their profits back into the business.
                      </p>

                      <h3 class='underline'>D.R.I.P</h3>

                      <p>It’s common for a company to offer their shareholders a <b>Dividend Reinvestment Plan</b>.
                        This <b>diverts</b> whatever amount of money that a shareholder would’ve received from dividends back into more <b>shares</b> of the company.
                        These are shares which the company has bought from the <b>open market</b> or is holding in their <b>treasury</b> for future use.
                        Since shares for the D.R.I.P are coming directly from the company, they're able to sell them to current shareholders at slight <b>discount</b> to the current market price.
                        Companies do this to <b>incentivise</b> investors to buy more shares and put more money back into the company.
                        A lot of investors opt for a D.R.I.P because it helps them to <b>dollar-cost average</b>.

                    <h3 class='underline'>Capital Gain/Loss</h3>
                    <p>
                    Common shareholders are obliged to participate in a company's <b>wins</b> and <b>losses</b>.
                    All this means is that as the <b>price</b> of a stock goes <b>up</b> and <b>down</b>, so does the <b>value</b> of the shares held by investors.
                    A <b>capital gain</b> occurs when a share is sold for <b>higher</b> than what it was bought for.
                    A <b>capital loss</b> occurs when a share is sold for <b>lower</b> than what it was bought for.
                    A capital gain or loss is only realized once the position has been <b>closed</b> and the gain/loss is reflected in the account.
                    Up until then, the capital gain/loss is said to be <b>unrealized</b>. The possibility of capital gain is what makes investing in common shares so <b>attractive</b>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <b>NOTE</b>: The costs associated with trading such as commissions and brokerage fees must be taken into account when calculating a capital gain/loss.
                    The Adjusted Cost Base(ACB) is the method used to factor these costs in. Learn more about it <a class ="links" href="https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/calculating-adjusted-cost-base-6285">here</a>.
                    For the ease of understanding, throughout the rest of the text, capital gain/loss will solely be referred to as the difference between the buying and selling price.

          <h3 class='underline'>Going Long</h3>
          <p>
           A <b>long</b> position consists of <b>buying</b> and taking ownership of shares with the belief that they will eventually <b>increase</b> in price.
           The price of a stock <b>increases</b> if there are more potential <b>buyers</b> than there are <b>sellers</b> in the market.
           Each buyer is willing to pay a <b>higher price</b> per share because there is only a <b>limited supply</b>.
           In order to <b>close</b> out a long position, shares are simply <b>sold</b> to another investor on the secondary market and a capital gain/loss is realized.
           </p>





          <h3 class='underline'>Going Short</h3>

          <p>
            There are always going to be periods where a stock is falling or trending downwards and this is where short-selling can be very useful.
            <b>Short selling</b> or <b>shorting</b> a stock means betting <b>against</b> it and hoping it <b>decreases</b> in price.
            The price of a stock <b>decreases</b> if there are more sellers than buyers in the market.
            Buyers know that sellers are <b>desperate</b> to get rid of their shares and because of this, are able to put <b>downwards pressure</b> on the price by <b>refusing</b> to purchase them at the current offering price. Sellers are then forced to sell their shares at a price that is generally lower than what they initially wanted.
            The first step of shorting a stock is <b>orrowing shares</b>  from someone called a <b>broker</b>.
            A broker is a person or firm that has access to a <b>large inventory</b> of shares from most companies.
            The borrower is obligated to <b>return</b> those shares to the broker at some point in the future but in the meantime, they’re <b>sold</b> to another investor on the secondary market and a short position is created.
            All the proceeds from the short sale are deposited into the <b>investor's account</b>.
            Covering a short position is when shares are <b>bought</b> from the open market and subsequently returned to the broker.
            If the stock price <b>decreases</b> and the position is covered, a <b>capital gain</b> is realized.
            However, if the stock price <b>increases</b> and the position is covered, a <b>capital loss</b> is realized.
            The downside of short selling is that there’s <b>unlimited risk </b>involved. No matter how <b>high</b> the price of a stock is, an investor is obligated to return the <b>original number of shares</b> borrowed back to the broker in order to meet their end of the agreement.

          <h3 class='underline'>Taxes</h3>
          <p>
           In Canada there are <b>two</b> main branches of income tax: <b>federal</b> and <b>provincial</b>.
           Canada uses a <b>progressive</b> tax system, meaning that the amount of tax someone owes is <b>proportional</b> to how much they make. For example,
           a person earning <b>$80,000</b> will owe <b>more</b> in taxes than someone who earns <b>$50,000</b>.
           Tax brackets were made for both federal and provincial taxes and are segregated through <b>increasing</b> levels of income which are taxed at increasingly <b>higher</b> rates.
           What this means is that different amounts of your income are taxed at different rates. For example, if you make $80,0000, x amount of dollars are taxed at one rate, y amount of dollars are taxed at another and so and so on.
           Find the tax rates for the 2021 year <a class ="links" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html" target = "_blank">here</a>.
           </p>

          <p>
          An individual’s <b>marginal</b> tax rate is the <b>highest</b> rate at which an <b>additional dollar</b> of income is taxed at. In most cases, it's also the rate at which a person’s <b>last dollar</b> of income is taxed at.
          Since there are two layers of taxes in Canada, in most cases, an individual’s marginal tax rate is essentially the <b>sum</b> of the two separate marginal rates.
          It’s important to understand marginal tax rates because an individual might want to consider the tax consequences of earning <b>additional income</b>.
          For some people, earning more will cause them to move up into a <b>higher</b> tax bracket and the majority of additional income might be <b>lost</b> to taxes.
          <b>Average tax</b> is calculted by dividing the the amount of tax owed by taxable income.
          </p>

            Although, it may seem like we're paying so much in taxes at times, it's done in order to sustain our standard and quality of living in Canada. <a class ="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9SHsUSpWAw" target= "_blank">Here</a> is a short video explaining where tax dollars really go

    <h3 class='underline GTSI'>Taxation of Investment Income</h3>


        <div class="">
          <div class="">
            <h6 class = "underline">Capital Gains/Losses</h6>
            <p class="">
            In Canada, <b>50%</b> of all <b>capital gains</b> an investor makes has to be reported as <b>income</b>.
            For example, in 2020, say Monica made $80,000 from her job and $400 worth of capital gains.
            When it comes time to file taxes, only <b>$200</b> of her capital gains are taxable and
            this would in turn raise her total <b>taxable income</b> to $80,200 for that year.
            From there, Monica would pay her provincial and federal tax just as she would’ve if there had been no capital gains.
            A common misconception about capital gains are that they’re taxed <b>AT</b> 50%, so you’re required to give up half your capital gain in taxes.
            This is <b>NOT TRUE</b>(for most individuals), the amount of tax an individual pays on their capital gains is entirely dependent on their marginal tax rate. Only those in the higher tier tax brackets have their capital gains taxed at very close or even above that 50% mark.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for capital losses, they’re responsible for <b>offsetting</b> capital gains.
              Let’s say that Monica made $400 in <b>capital gains</b> but also suffered $200 in <b>capital losses</b>.
              She is left with a <b>net capital gain</b> of $200 and must report 50%($100) of it when she files her taxes.
              The only exception to doing this is the <b>thirty day rule</b>, which states that if a security is bought within <b>30 days</b> of selling it,
              it is considered a <b>superficial loss</b> and cannot be used to offset capital gains.
              Say if Monica bought 10 shares of ABC at 10$, sold them for $8 but then bought shares of ABC again at $12 all within a 30 day period, her initial capital loss of $20 could not be used to offset any capital gains incurred in that year.
            </p>

          <div class="">
            <h6 class = "underline">Dividend Income </h6>
            <p class='guide'>
              The taxation of dividend income, similar to capital gains, relies heavily on an individual’s <b>marginal tax rate</b>.
              Taxing dividends is a rather complicated procedure with a lot of tedious  calculations. Get a brief overview of the process <a class ="links" href="https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/the-federal-dividend-tax-credit-in-canada-332" target = "_blank">here</a>.
              One of the main concepts around the taxation of dividend income is the idea of <b>eligible</b> and <b>non-eligible</b> dividends. Whether a dividend is eligible or not is completely dependent
              on a company's <b>structure</b> and <b>tax liabilities</b>. Since dividend income is paid out of a company's retained earnings account, an account that holds income that has undergone <b>taxation</b>, there is a <b>tax credit</b> provided to the investors who recieve these dividends. A tax credit is a dollar amount that <b>reduces</b> the amount of taxes
              an individual owes. For example, if Jeffrey owes $5,000 in taxes but has a dividend tax credit of $500, he would only owe <b>$4500</b>.
              Essentially, dividends that come from Canadian corporations will provide <b>higher dividend</b> tax credits so both the corporation and investor don't end up paying tax on the same amount. Smaller businesses issue dividends that are classified as <b>non-eligible</b>, which means that the business itself doesn't get taxed too harshly, resulting in a <b>smaller</b> dividend tax credit.
              Another caveat of the dividend tax credit is that in order to actually be entitled to it, the company must be <b>Canadian</b> and the investor recieving it has to be a <b>Canadian resident</b>. Dividends from foreign companies are <b>non-eligible</b> are taxed as <b>interest income</b> and don't provide any tax credits.
              </p>

          <div class="">
            <h6 class = "underline">Interest Income</h6>
            <p class='guide'>
              The income that’s received from <b>bonds</b> or other <b>fixed income</b> securities is classified as interest income and the full amount is taxed like <b>employment income</b>(regular income).
              Unlike dividends or capital gains, interest income has a very simple taxation structure with not too many exceptions.

              There are online brokerages that are offered by third party firms and major banks.
              However, before buying and selling shares through an online brokerage, an investor must decide which account is best for holding different securities in.
              There're an array of different accounts that were created for different people that have different goals.
              The account holders of the accounts discussed below aren't required to pay tax on <b>capital gains, eligible dividends</b> and <b>interest income</b>   while they accrue in the account or when they're taken out. The most common things held inside these types of accounts are cash, stocks, bonds, investment funds and GIC's

              <p> <b>Example:</b> Sam turns 18 years old in July and opens up a TFSA. The annual limit for the year is $6000 and Sam manages to contribute $5000 by the end of October leaving him with $1000 of contribution room. Unfortunately, his car breaks down and he has to take out $2000 for repairs which makes his total contribution room for future years $3000 and only $1000 for the current year. However, Sam gets lucky
              and his car repairs only cost him $500. He decides to put the remaining $1500 back into his TFSA but Sam has now over contributed to his account by $500. He must withdraw the $500 or he risks a fine of $5 per month until it's taken out.
              Sam takes the $500 and he has technically maxed out his TFSA although there's only $4000 in the account. The withdrawal of $2000 will be added to his contribution room starting the next year.</p>

            <h6 class = "underline">Registered Retirement Savings Plan</h6>
            <ul class = "bullet-list">
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Established in order to encourage Canadians to save funds to use throughout their retirement period</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  <b>Contribution Limit:</b> 18% of the plan holder's taxable income <b>OR</b> the annual contribution space set by the federal government. The lesser of the two amounts will be the contribution limit. </li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Contributions are tax deductible meaning that they <b>reduce</b> taxable income. The deductions don't necessarily have to be used in the same year the contribution is made but can carry forward and be used in future years.   </li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Once the contribution limit is reached, you cannot contribute anymore in that calendar year or it will result in a monthly fine of 1% on the over contributed amount until it is taken out. However, the government does allow a leeway of <b>$2000</b> without a fine but that amount is not tax deductible.</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Before the end of the year which the plan holder turns 71, the RRSP must be turned into a <b>Registered Retirement Income Fund</b>(RRIF) and all this means is that a certain amount of money has to be withdrawn each year from the fund and be taxed as employment income under the holder. There's no <b>minimum age </b>to turn an RRSP into an RRIF, but it's generally done once the plan holder retires and is earning little to no income</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  As for funds that are withdrawn from an RRSP, there is a <b>witholding tax </b>that will be charged before the money is actually released. The witholding tax rates can be found <a class = "links" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/making-withdrawals/tax-rates-on-withdrawals.html" target = "_blank">here</a>. These tax rates are quite high which is why it's not a smart decision to take funds from an RRSP unless it's absolutely necessary </li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Unlike a TFSA, withdrawals result in a <b>permanent loss</b> in contribution room which is another reason why you shouldn't take money from an RRSP </li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Besides the withholding tax all funds withdrawn from an RRSP are <b>added</b> to the taxable income for that year when taxes are filed, meaning they'll still undergo federal and provincial taxation</li>
              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  Unused contribution room carries over from year to year</li>
            </ul>

            <p> <b>Note:</b> RRSP contribution room starts to pile up when tax returns are filed. This means that as long as the government keeps getting a notification that you've been working and earning money in a given year, the appropriate contribution room will be there for you. Unlike a TFSA, there's no minimum age for an RRSP.</p>

              <p> <b> Example:</b> Judy is 25 years old and has a total of $20,000 in her RRSP. She made a pre-tax income of $100,000 in 2020 and she's trying to determine her RRSP contribution limit for the year. 18% of her income would be $18,000 which is less than the federal limit of $27,230. Therefore, Judy's contribution room is $18,000. Judy decides to deduct $2932 of the $18000 from her pre-tax income in order to take her from a 26% federal income tax to 20.5%. Judy now has $15,068 in deductions for future years. Judy has fallen on some tough times and requires funds immediately and she decides to withdraw $16,000 from her RRSP. Well, automatically 30% of that goes to the government and Judy only recieves only $11,200. This $11,200 will then be added to her taxable income and undergo another round of taxation.</p>

              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i>  RESP is made up of 2 main components: </li>
              <div class="indented-list">

                <ul class ="">
                  <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> <b>Contributions: </b>The money actually put into the plan. This can be withdrawn at any time and there's no <b>fees</b> or <b>taxes</b> on it since contributions are made after taxes. The payments should be going towards education but there's no law against using it for other purposes.</li>
                  <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> <b>Grants and Accumulated Income:</b> The government helps plan holders save more income by providing grants depending on how much is contributed. The maximum amount of grants per beneficiary is <b>$7200</b>. Additionally, low income families can also qualify for Canada Learning Bonds which pay $100 yearly until 15 for those born after December 2003. Grants and other government money must go towards the beneficary's(who the plan is for) education. Accumulated income is the income from capital gains, dividends or interest and this amount must also go towards education. "Education" really means any expenses that the beneficary has while in school like food, furniture, rent etc. As for taxes, this component of the RESP is taxed as regular income under the <b>beneficiary</b> who likely has little to no income, which means they pay almost nothing in taxes! </li>

                </ul>
              </div>

              <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> If the beneficiary does not go to school the RESP can stay open for 36 years and sometimes they may choose further education down the line. If not there are a couple of options available.</li>
              <div class="indented-list">

                <ul class ="">
                  <li> <b>1)</b> Tranfer to another child's RESP as long as they have contribution room left and aren't over the grant limit of $7200.</li>
                  <li> <b>2)</b> If a transfer is not possible the grant portion of the RESP must be returned and there are no exceptions to this.</li>
                  <li> <b>3)</b> Transfer the accumulated income to an RRSP as long as contribution room is available and under $50,000. However, the transfer into the RRSP from the RESP is not tax deductible since you're already saving on taxes.

                  <li> <b>4)</b> If the accumulated income is withdrawn, it will be taxed under the plan holder's name(adult) along with a 20% penalty.</li>
