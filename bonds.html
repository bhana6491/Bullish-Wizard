          <h3 class='underline'>OTC Markets</h3>

          <p>
            Due to the <b>complicated</b> nature of bonds, they’re sold in <b>Over-The-Counter(OTC)</b> markets as opposed to exchanges.
            Besides bonds, the majority of financial securities like stocks are listed on the OTC markets because they don’t
            meet <b>exchange requirements</b> or don’t want to pay to be listed. The number of trades occuring on a per minute or per hour basis on the OTC markets is relatively low when compared to the big exchanges.
            As a result, a lot of the securities on the OTC markets aren’t <b>liquid</b>. Liquidity refers to the <b>speed</b> at which an investor is able to buy and
            sell shares for and since there’s a relatively lower volume of trades occurring, investors can have a hard time liquidating their positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, what will happen is that investment brokers/dealers will post <b>bid</b> and <b>ask</b> prices on decentralized market places which the public doesn't have access to. Different
            dealers/brokers will have an <b>inventory</b> of these securities from which they add to and sell from to make their own profit.
            Trades in the OTC markets are conducted through <b>online platforms</b>, <b>phone</b> and <b>email</b>. Buyers and sellers are in direct contact with each other and unlike in an exchange where the trade goes through a system,
            the trade is executed <b>directly</b> between the two parties. This means that any information relating to the trade like price or number of shares is not <b>disclosed</b> to the public.

          <b>Face Value</b>&nbsp<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbsp The amount that the bond is <b>first</b> sold for. It is also the same amount that the bond issuer <b>promises</b> to pay back at the end of the <b>loan</b> period.

        <p>
          <b>Maturity Date</b>&nbsp<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>&nbspThe <b>end</b> of the loan period. The bond matures at the maturity date and is the date at which the face value is <b>returned</b> to the bondholder.

        <p>
          <b>Term to Maturity</b>&nbsp<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"> </i>&nbspThe time remaining before a bond matures
        </p>


        <p>
          <b>Bond Price</b>&nbsp<i class="fas fa-arrow-right"> </i>&nbspBonds are first sold in the primary market in certain denominations such as $1000, $10,000 and $100,000. When a bond is traded in the secondary market, its price is quoted
          using an index with a base value of <b>100</b>. What this means is that if a bond is trading at 100, it's currently trading at the same price at which it was first issued for(face value). If a bond trades <b>below</b> 100, it’s said to be trading at a <b>discount</b>. If it trades <b>above</b> 100, it’s trading at a <b>premium</b>.
        </p>
        <p><b>Example: </b>A Government of Canada bond has $1000 face value, a 5% coupon, it matures in 5 years and is quoted at 97. It can be said that every $100 of the bond costs $97. A potential buyer will only have to pay $970 to buy the
          $1000 bond, therefore, the bond is currently trading at a discount. At the maturity date, the bondholder will receive the face value of $1000. </p>
        <h6 class="underline">Why Buy a Bond at a Premium ?</h6>

        <p>
          If the coupon on the bond is big enough to cover the <b>capital loss</b> and leave a sufficient enough return thereafter, it may be <b>worthwhile</b> to buy a bond at a premium.
          For example, say if bond A has a 5% coupon and bond B has a 12% coupon. Both bonds have a face value of $1000 and they both mature in <b>two years</b>. However, bond A trades at face value(<b>$1000</b>) while bond B trades at <b>$1050</b>. Total payments from bond A equal <b>$100 </b>and total
          payments from bond B equal <b>$200</b>. In the end, the payments from bond B would cover the capital loss and leave the bond holder with <b>$150</b> profit. Gain to this extent is unlikely in a real market, however, this method of investing in bonds is definetely worth looking at.

          <h3 class='underline'>Return on a Bond</h3>
          <p>Income from a bond is generally made up of two main sources: <b>Interest Income </b>and <b>Capital Gains</b>. Different investors use these sources of income in order to determine the <b>return</b> of a bond. All investors don't employ the same style of
            investing and this leads to different measurments of the return on a bond. </p>

          <h6 class="underline">1) Current Yield</h6>
          <p>The current yield measures the return on a bond relative to its purchase price. The face value of the bond is irrelevant when calculating this type of return since investors interested in it are not looking to hold the bond until
            maturity and are just looking to make a relatively quick profit via coupon payments or capital gains.    </p>
          <div class="centre">

          <img class = "" src="images/formula.png" alt="">

        </div>
        <p><b>Example: </b> Tim is looking to buy a bond but wants to ensure that it's a good deal for him. The bond he's looking at has a maturity date of 5 years with a face value of $1000 and 5% coupon with semi annual payments. Remember that the coupon is on a  <b>yearly basis</b>, therefore, Tim would recieve two payments of $25 during the year. The market price is $980 so it's being sold at a discount. The current yield of the bond would be approximately: (25+25)/980 = 5.1%. Current yield puts the return of a bond into a much better perspective for the investor.</p>
          <h6 class="underline">2) Yield to Maturity</h6>
          <p>Refers to the return on the bond if the following conditions are met:</p>
          <div class="rules-ytm">
            <p> <b>1)</b> Held to maturity </p>
            <p> <b>2)</b> Coupon payments are reinvested at a rate equivalent to the coupon rate</p>

          </div>

          <p> <b>NOTE:</b> Most investors aren't really going to spend coupon payments since they can be put into another investment that brings the investor additional return. Generally, the coupon payment will go into some sort of investment vehicle that provides a similar rate of return to the bond. This is why the 2nd condition of calculating YTM exists.</p>

          <p>The YTM is by far the most <b>accurate</b> depiction of the return on a bond and is a very beneficial when comparing bonds. Long term investors will often look at the YTM along with other characteristics of the bond to determine if it’s a
            good investment. It’s unlikely for bonds to trade at par value and they almost always trade
            above or below that level. The YTM is generally one of <b>three</b> rates; If the bond is trading at face value, the YTM will <b>equal</b> the coupon rate, if it’s trading at a discount, it will be <b>higher</b> than the coupon rate and if it’s trading at a
            premium, it will be <b>lower</b> than the coupon rate. </p>

          <h6 class="underline">Why YTM Makes Sense ?</h6>

          <p>Timmy buys a bond for $1020, that has a $1000 face value, a 5% coupon and a maturity date in 2 years. Because he bought the bond at a premium, he will only receive $1000 at maturity and incur a capital loss of $20. This loss
            reduces his overall return because it reduces the return he gets from his coupons. Over the life of the bond, he receives coupon payments totalling $100 but because of his capital loss, he only ends up with $80. The current yield would indicate his annual return to be 5% but his YTM is really only around 3%.

          <h3 class='underline'>Who Chooses the Coupon Rate ? </h3>

          <p>
            Most investors buy bonds in order to receive the coupon payments that come as a result of owning it. When a bond is first issued, its coupon rate is usually derived from the <b>market interest rate</b>. The market interest rate is simply the
            rate at which different financial institutions like banks, offer on <b>cash deposits</b> and other <b>consumer loan products</b>. Examples of some of the coupon rates for government of Canada bonds can be found <a class ="links" href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/canadian-bonds/" target = "_blank">here</a>. Notice that the rates aren’t very
            high, on average they’re near 0.5% to 3% and this is due to different bonds having different <b>terms to maturity</b>. There are 3 categories of bonds: short term, medium term and long term. <b>Short term</b> bonds mature in 3 years or less, <b>medium term</b>
            bonds mature in 3-10 years and <b>long term </b>bonds mature in 10+ years. The reason why the coupon rates <b>rise</b> as the term to maturity <b>increases</b> is because it’s a way to incentivise investors to <b>lock up</b> their money for 5, 10 or x
            amount of years. It's not logical for a person who's investing in a 2 year bond to get the same coupon as someoe who's investing in a 10 year bond because that first person gets their principal back after 2 years and can invest it somewhiere else. But that other investor's money is locked up for another 8 years and they don't get the luxury of potentially making a higher return on some other investment.
          </p>

          <h3 class='underline'>Bond Ratings</h3>

          <p>
            Back when bonds were first created, every walk of life bought them from big companies to workers in blue collar jobs. Researching a company and trying to determine if they’re creditworthy(trustworthy) is a fairly challenging task because it requires a lot
            of due diligence and background knowledge. <b>Standard and Poor’s</b> bond rating system was created in order to inform investors of the risk of company’s bond issue and the likelihood of a company paying it's debt. Have a
            look at the rating system  <a class ="links" href="https://www.maalot.co.il/publications/gmt20160204150108.pdf" target = "_blank">here</a>. Essentially, a higher rating translates to a higher chance that a company will be able to repay their debt (bond’s face value + coupons). Government bonds are always rated a <b>AAA</b> because it's pretty much guaranteed that
            the principal will be paid back. Lower ratings translate to <b>uncertainty</b> or probable inability of a company being able to repay its debt. The S&P’s main job is to do deep dive into a
            company’s financial statements and find important reports and signals that they will then compare to their standards in order to conclude the approximate risk level of the bond issue. Companies usually pay credit rating agencies a fixed fee in order to rate their
            bonds because it has become the standard and without a rating, a bond issue is unlikely to sell nowadays.
          </p>

          <img class = "rating-image" src="images/sand.png" alt="">

        </div>
          <h3 class='underline'>Callable Bonds</h3>

          <p>
            If interest rates happen to go up after Company A issues bonds, it doesn’t affect them in any way since they’ll continue to pay the same fixed coupon rate that was initially agreed upon. However, if interest rates fall, every other issuer
            will start to issue bonds with <b>lower</b> coupons just because they can. Company A is stuck paying an unnecessarily high coupon rate so they <b>call</b> or redeem their bonds. They’re able to do this because there is a clause in most bond contracts
            that allow them to do so. Usually, a company will outline what year they have the option to call the bond and when this time comes, they declare what’s known as <b>call price</b>, which is slightly above the bond's face value and is what they
            pay the bondholders in exchange to end the agreement between them. For example, say interest rates fall and company A declares a call price of $110 for their $100 bonds. Anyone who currently has their bonds can redeem them and get a little
            bit extra on top of what they initially bought it for. Companies do this to make up for any <b>inconvenience</b> they might have caused by calling the bond prior to maturity. After they do this, company A might decide to issue new bonds at
            a lower coupon rate that matches the current prevailing market interest rate in order to raise the same amount of capital at a lower cost.

            <div>


              <h6 class="underline">Default Risk</h6>
              <p>
                In most cases, when a bond is bought, the issuer is <b>obligated</b> to regularly give out interest payments to the holder as well as repay the loan amount at maturity. If they fail to do so, the bond holders can decide to file a <b>claim</b> on the
                company’s assets. Usually, if a company is not able to pay their bondholders, they’re in a rough enough financial position where they must file for <b>bankruptcy</b>. What this means is that the business is not making enough money and they have to sell off all their assets in order
                pay back as much of their debt as possible. Bondholders have the <b>strongest</b> claim on assets because they’re essentially <b>creditors</b>(people who the company owes money to), while shareholders are at the bottom of the list because they’re technically owners of the company. If
                this occurs, bondholders may recoup most, if not all of their initial investment but there’s no guarantee. It’s very important to know the financial well being of a company before buying any of their bonds to avoid default risk.

              <h6 class='underline'>Interest Rate Risk</h6>

              <p>
                Interest rates and the price of bonds are <b>inversely</b> related. When market interest rates <b>increase</b>, the price of bonds <b>decrease</b> and vice versa. For example, company A decides to issue bonds with a face value of $100 and a 5% coupon at a
                time when market interest rates are 5%. The market rates now increase to 6% and company B decides to issue bonds with the same face value but offers a 6% coupon. No one is going to want to buy bonds offered by company A because they would
                rather buy bonds from company B. Company A’s bonds automatically become less valuable to investors and as a result must be sold at a <b>discount</b> to draw in buyers. The price of bond A must be lowered in order to make the <b>YTM</b> reflect the
                current market interest rate. Initially, the YTM of company A’s bonds are 5% but since market rates go up, the bond is sold at a price of $95.73. This price enables the investors to receive a return of 6% that’s partly made up of
                <b>interest income</b> and some <b>capital gain</b>.

              <h6 class='underline'>Inflationary Risk</h6>


              <p>
                Inflation is the concept that a dollar today will be worth less than a dollar in the future. It’s the measure that tracks the steady rise in prices of goods and services over time. Watch a quick video to get a better understanding of <a class ="links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2AnmVZjHZg" target = "_blank">inflation</a>.
                There are two main forms of inflation, <b>cost push</b> inflation and <b>demand pull</b> inflation. Cost push inflation is inflation that arises from an increase in the <b>cost</b> to produce a good/service. When
                production costs increase, a company can choose to push it onto its consumers by charging a <b>higher price</b> for the same good/service. For example, if a company uses lumber to make their products and the price of lumber suddenly
                increases due to a shortage, the company can just increase the price which they sell their product for instead of bearing the cost of it themselves. Demand-Pull inflation occurs when the price of a good/service increases because demand <b>outweighs</b> supply. As
                demand <b>increases</b> and supply stays the same, businesses know that the people who really want a product are willing to pay more for it because there’s only a limited quantity available. They business will then raise the price of their products just enough to hopefully
                deter enough buyers to the point where they’re able to fully supply those that are able to pay the higher price.
              </p>

            <p>
              The risk of inflation should be looked at prior to buying any <b>long term bonds</b>. When investors believe that inflation is on the rise, they look for bonds with higher interest
              rates to <b>offset</b> any loss in buying power from the coupons. For example, Dan buys a 10 year bond with a $100 face value and a coupon of 5%. Inflation is expected to rise and because of this, the $5 coupon payment will slowly start to
              be worth less and less as years pass. Say Dan uses his first coupon payment to buy a pack of pencils that cost $4. Over the years the cost of a pack of pencils, along with other goods and services start to increase and since Dan’s
              coupon payments are fixed, they slowly start to become incapable of covering the cost of his desired good. After 10 years, he goes back to the store with his last coupon payment and the pack of pencils now cost $7 because of inflation. This
              is why most bond investors seek a bond with an additional 2% return on top of their desired coupon rate to account for inflation. If Dan knew that inflation was going to increase in the long term, he would look for a bond with
              a 7% coupon in order to always be able to afford the pack of pencils every year for 10 years.
            </p>

          <p> <b>NOTE:</b> Inflation will never be as extreme as the example presented above. Inflation is closely monitored by the Bank of Canada and it is their job to keep inflation low. They do this by employing different strategies like
            influencing interest rates, setting monetary policy and more. </p>

          <p>
            Investors who buy bonds are generally more <b>risk-averse</b> and look for safer investments. By nature, bonds aren’t the easiest securities to understand and the purchasing process can often be very confusing. Furthermore, bond
            returns are heavily reliant on <b>macroeconomic</b> factors and these factors can be very difficult for novice or even well experienced investors to wrap their heads around. Nowadays, investing in bonds is primarily done through some sort of
            fund that incorporates bonds into their portfolio or is a portfolio that is entirely made up of bonds. Bond funds can employ different strategies like only buying bonds with a certain <b>rating</b> or buying bonds with different <b>terms to maturity</b>.
            Regardless, this takes the pressure off the investor since they aren’t required to keep track of the individual bonds and their investment is being handled by a professional. How investment funds tend to work is that the team behind the fund will go out,
            research the market, buy bonds, receive the coupon payments and then distribute them accordingly amongst the investors. Bonds are also being bought and sold frequently depending on the team's outlook on the overall economy and factors like future interest rates and inflation risks.
            The days of buying individual bonds are over, investing in successful bond funds can provide an investor with <b>safety</b> of their initial investment as well as a <b>cash flowing</b> security.

          <h3 class='underline'>GIC</h3>
          <p>
            A Guaranteed Investment Certificate is a type of fixed income investment that provide holders with a <b>fixed interest rate</b> in exchange for a sum of capital. The majority of GIC’s are offered by <b>banks</b> and are considered <b>low risk</b>
            investments since any capital invested is guaranteed to be returned. GICs offer relatively <b>lower</b> interest rates than some other securities but aren’t too far off from some of the coupon rates offered by <b>short-medium term bonds</b>. Compare
            and contrast some of the GIC rates <a class ="links" href="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/personal-investing/products/gic/gic-rates-canada/" target = "_blank">here</a>. GIC’s work the same way as bonds; Money is given to the issuer up front, interest is paid based off the principal and then the total loan amount is returned. The main difference between the two
            securities is that GIC’s <b>cannot</b> be sold for <b>capital gain</b>. Whether an individual chooses to invest in a bond or a GIC is completely dependent on their view of where interest rates are going and seeing if there’s a possibility for capital
            gain in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two main types of GICs: cashable and non-cashable. <b>Cashable GICs</b> permit the holder to liquidate the GIC <b>earlier</b> than the maturity date. <b>Non-cashable GICs</b> generally don’t allow early withdrawal, but depending on the issuer, a fee
            can be paid to do so. Cashable GICs offer <b>lower</b> interest rates than non-cashable GICs because they’re more <b>liquid</b>. Liquidity refers to the <b>speed</b> at which a security is able to be turned into <b>cash</b> and cashable-GIC holders have this option
            at any time. GIC’s are typically meant to save funds in the short term without much risk. Individuals who are risk averse, need capital in the near future or just require some form of liquid investments are all ideal buyers of GIC’s.
