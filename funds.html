  <h3 class = 'underline'>Mutual Funds</h3>
  <p>
    A mutual fund is a pool of capital that is put towards buying and maintaining a portfolio of financial securities. The fund itself is owned by an investment management company who appoints a fund manager responsible for managing the portfolio’s success. The financial securities which make up a mutual fund can all be from the same asset class or a certain mixture containing all of them. Mutual fund companies can be classified as institutional investors because they hold relatively large positions in any given asset class or company that they invest in. Because of this, the individuals who invest in mutual funds are exposed to a wide range of securities that they would otherwise never have access to. For example, the RBC Global Tech fund has companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple in their portfolio. The price of one unit in the fund is $12.10 and there’s a minimum investment of $500. Mutual funds are a great option for new investors who aren’t too familiar with the financial markets and would rather put the fate of their investment in the hands of someone more experienced. Also, individuals with long term investment horizons are suitable investors for mutual funds because they generally provide better returns in the long run than in the short run. Unlike stocks and bonds, mutual funds are generally bought from distributors who’re tasked with selling units of the fund. Investment advisors, brokers and financial planners are all examples of distributors of mutual funds in Canada. These third party distributors usually charge a sales tax which compensates them for researching as well as advising the investor on the type of fund to buy and for executing the transaction on their behalf.
  </p>

  <h6 class = 'underline'>Types of Mutual Funds</h6>

  <p>
    There are two main forms of mutual funds, open ended funds and closed ended funds. The majority of mutual funds are open-ended which means that they’re always accepting new investors and they don’t have a maximum unit limit. If a fund is closed-ended, capital is only raised once and a fixed number of shares are issued to investors. Generally, open ended funds have units and closed ended funds have shares. A mutual fund makes money for its investors through capital gains, interest income and dividends they incur from holding, buying and selling securities throughout the calendar year. Almost all of the income that’s made from a mutual fund is distributed to its unit holders because the company behind the fund wants to minimize the amount of taxes it has to pay. Distributions transfer the tax burden onto the unitholder, which in turn allows the company to give out a larger portion of income generated from the fund since it isn’t taxed under them first. In almost all cases, tax treatment on distributions for unit holders are always better than a corporation, therefore, distributions benefit both parties. Besides distributions, unitholders also have the option of redeeming their units for a capital gain. When units are redeemed, the unitholder is selling their units back to the company in exchange for the current price of a unit. Fund companies keep a certain amount of cash on hand for redemptions to avoid having to liquidate positions in their portfolio.
  </p>


  <h6 class = 'underline'>How Mutual Funds are Priced</h6>

  <p>
    Total assets less any liabilities is a fund’s Net Asset Value(NAV) and is calculated daily when all the underlying securities stop trading. The NAV is the primary measure of a fund’s popularity and/or success. Net Asset Value Per Share(NAVPS) is the NAV divided by the total number of units outstanding and is the price that an investor is quoted upon buying a unit of the fund. If an individual wants to buy a unit today, the distributor will quote the price of the fund(NAVPS) using the previous day’s value. This is done because a fund can be made up of 50-60 companies and the NAV is constantly fluctuating throughout the entire day, making it near impossible to determine a fair price at any given time. This method of buying units can sometimes come as a benefit but other times be a disadvantage. Besides market conditions, the NAVPS decreases proportionally to the distributions made to unitholders. For example, at year end, fund XYZ has a NAVPS of $24 and they decide to give out a $6 distribution to all unitholders. The NAVPS would drop to $18 since the distribution is paid out of the fund. Investors are not losing money, the composition of their investment is simply being moved around.

  </p>


  <h6 class = 'underline'>Costs</h6>

  <p>
    From management expenses to operating expenses, a mutual fund incurs a number of costs throughout the year to ensure that the fund is as successful as possible. The management expense ratio(MER) is the total fees and expenses a fund incurs over the year expressed as a percentage of the average NAV for the year. The MER of a typical fund is usually in the 0.5%-2% range. In 2020, the RBC Global Tech Fund had a MER of 0.98% and had an average NAV of $347.8 million, meaning they collected over $3.4 million in management fees over the given calendar year. The MER is taken out of the fund itself which means it reduces the NAV and NAVPS. A small portion of the MER is generally calculated and taken out on a daily basis to ensure that there’s not a significant drop in the funds value in a single day.

  <h3 class = 'underline'>ETF</h3>
  <p>
Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs are funds that are distributed to investors through an exchange instead of a distributor. Like mutual funds, there can be one or multiple asset classes that make up an ETF. An ETF provider, someone who wants to create an ETF, enters into a contractual agreement with a designated broker. The broker is a market maker or represents a large investment dealer/company that has access to or can gain access to a large inventory of the shares that the provider is looking for. The broker gives the provider the desired shares and in return, receives a block of ETF units. When this trade occurs, the value of each share is based on the NAVPS which is found by dividing the market value of all the securities held in the fund by the size of the creation unit. In most cases, the creation unit will be 50,000 shares. Since units are bought and sold on an exchange, the price of an ETF will fluctuate due to the supply and demand of units. An ETF can trade above or below its NAV but does not tend to deviate from it very often. This is because the market price of an ETF is essentially the NAV and the NAV is dependent on the performance of the securities within the fund. In short, as the NAV of an ETF increases, the price of an ETF unit increases and vice versa.
</p>

<p>


  Just like mutual funds, realizing capital gains and receiving distributions are the two primary methods of making money from ETF’s. After accounting for their expenses, ETFs distribute interest income and dividends to their shareholders but rarely give out distributions that include capital gains. Usually, capital gains are distributed annually and generally occur, when shares have to be sold to prevent further loss or because they go against investment objectives. All in all, ETFs don’t undergo as many taxable events as mutual funds, leaving investors with larger returns. Most ETFs are based on a certain stock or bond index which means they offer lower MERs than index based mutual funds since fees and transaction costs are covered by the designated broker instead of the shareholders. Finally, the two key advantages of investing in ETFs over mutual funds are that they can be traded throughout the hours of an exchange and since they act like shares, they can be sold short just like any other security.

  <div id="index">

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Stock Index</h3>

        <p>
          A stock index tracks the performance of a certain set of companies and can help investors get a better understanding of the overall market or a subset of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) is among the most popular stock indices that investors follow closely to interpret the health of the U.S economy. Whenever you hear anyone say something like “The markets are down today” or make a generic reference to the economy, they’re most likely referring to the DJIA. The index is made up of 30 large and established American companies from a wide range of sectors including technology, financial services, energy and more. The DJIA is essentially just the sum of the stock prices of all 30 companies divided by the Dow Divisor. The Dow Divisor is a number that’s used to keep the average consistent throughout history and reduce the effects on the index due to stock splits or companies leaving the index. As of now, it is 0.14748071991788.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although there are many investors who stand by the DJIA, many believe that it’s not a good enough indicator of the US economy since it’s comprised of only 30 companies. Therefore, the S&P 500 index was created and is another well known index used for the same purpose as the Dow. The S&P 500 is a weighted index with the biggest companies having the heaviest weight. What this means is that any changes in the price of a stock that is heavily weighted, will result in a greater overall change in the index. Fluctuations in lower-weighted or smaller companies don’t have too great of an impact on the index as a whole. The S&P 500 is historically trending upwards which is why the index is widely used as a benchmark by investors to judge the success of their own portfolios. For example, if the S&P 500 gains 8% in a year and a fund manager happens to make a 12% return on his portfolio, he could say that he outperformed market that year. In Canada, investors look at the TSX/S&P composite index which is made up of around 250 of the top companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Due to the close relationship of Canada and the US, Canadian investors also pay very close attention to the Dow and the S&P500 because changes in the US economy can/do trickle down and have an impact on Canada’s Economy.
        </p>

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Index Funds</h3>
        <p>
        Index funds were created as a low cost alternative for investors to reap the benefits of a growing stock index without having to buy shares in 250 or 500 different companies. An index fund can come in the form of a mutual fund or an ETF and its main purpose is to mirror a particular index and its returns. To achieve this, a fund manager buys the same stocks that make up a certain index and places them all into a portfolio. In theory, the manager’s portfolio should achieve the same return as its benchmark index. Most index funds use the passive investment strategy, which means that managers don’t have to rebalance (buy and sell shares) frequently. In comparison, some mutual funds and ETFs use active management, which means that the fund manager is looking at the fund’s performance and appropriately rebalancing. Passively managed funds have a relatively lower MER than those that are actively managed since a lot less time and effort is put into ensuring the fund is successful. Since an index fund is just a branch of a mutual fund or an ETF, distributions and tax liabilities work are almost identical to those investment vehicles.

        <h6 class = "underline">Canadian Pension Plan</h6>
        <p>

The Canadian Pension Plan was set up for the residents of Canada to pay into during their working years and collect payments during their retirement. Every Permanent Resident above the age of 18 and below 65, earning at least $3,500 annually is required to pay into the CPP. The contribution amount is dependent on an individual’s annual income and can be found here. Employers are also required to match their employee’s CPP contributions. After this is done, the funds go to the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board(CPPIB). This is an organized group of financial professionals who’re responsible for investing all of Canada’s CPP contributions. The fund is among the largest institutional investors in Canada, managing upwards of $456.7 billion. The CPPIB holds international investments in public and private companies, as well as a variety of fixed income securities and even real estate holdings. The fund prioritizes investment strategies that don’t employ a large amount of risk, while still providing generous returns. The CPPIB is an independently run organization and doesn’t take any direction from the federal government regarding their investment decisions. The ultimate goal of the CPPIB is to provide Canadians with a stable amount of income during the final stage of their lives.
        </p>

        <h6 class = "underline">Hedge Funds</h6>

        <p>

Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in the sense that capital is pooled together in order to buy and maintain a portfolio of financial securities. Although, the fundamental concept is similar, there are many differences that exist between the two. Starting off with the fact that only accredited investors are able to put money into hedge funds. In Canada, an individual with a net worth surpassing $5 million or making an annual gross income of $200,000 is considered to be an accredited investor. The premise behind only letting accredited investors put money into the fund is that these investors are expected to have an above average understanding of the financial markets as well as an increased risk tolerance. The last thing hedge funds want is for the markets to dip and their investors hounding them every second because they’re scared that they’re going to lose their money. On top of being an accredited investor, a significant amount of capital has to be invested with the minimum investment ranging from $100,000 to $2 million.

        </p>


        <p>
          Capital that is invested into a hedge fund can be used however the hedge fund manager see’s best fit. Hedge fund managers employ high risk investment practices in order to achieve their desired returns. This can include short selling, the use of options and many other riskier strategies which mutual funds simply cannot do. When used correctly, these strategies provide a considerable return to not only the investors, but the managers as well. Hedge fund managers have a fee structure set up that in some cases, allows them to make upwards of 20% of the overall annual profits. Depending on who you ask they’ll say it’s a fair structure because ultimately, the fund manager played the biggest part in achieving that return. However, it’s important to understand that some fund managers struggle to make profits and can even report lower returns than mutual funds at times. As for the structure, there’s a limited liability structure in most hedge funds with the investors only being liable for their investment. This means that they can only lose as much as they put in and profits are divided according to the size of the initial investment.

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Online Brokerages</h3>

        <p>

          Entering and exiting the market has become a fairly simple task throughout the years. The growth of online brokerages have made it easier for the average investor to get access to the financial markets. In Canada, the top five banks: RBC, ScotiaBank, BMO, CIBC and TD all have dedicated online platforms for their clients to place their trades independently. When executing trades, all the user see’s is their trade being filled but there’s a lot going behind the scenes. Take RBC or Wealth Simple for example, they’re acting as brokers which essentially means that they’re middleman that connects a client to a certain marketplace(exchange). Without the broker, users would not be able to access the markets and make trades. The brokerage makes money by charging transaction fees every time a user enters and exits the markets. These fees can be rather expensive and can reduce the overall returns that the average investor makes. More recently, independent companies like Wealth Simple and Quest Trade have been steadily rising in popularity due to their low fees and transaction costs. These companies even allow investors to open TFSA’s and RRSP’s to store their securities and execute their trades.
