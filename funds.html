  <h6 class = 'underline'>Types of Mutual Funds</h6>

  <p>
    There are two main forms of mutual funds, <b>open-end</b> and <b>closed-end</b>. The majority of mutual funds are open-ended which means that they’re always accepting new investors and they don’t have a <b>maximum unit limit</b>. If a fund is closed-ended, capital is only raised once and a <b>fixed number</b> of shares are issued to investors. Generally, open ended funds have <b>units</b> and closed ended funds have <b>shares</b>. A mutual fund makes money for its investors through capital gains, interest income and dividends which they incur from holding as well as buying and selling securities throughout the calendar year. Almost all of the income that’s made from a mutual fund is <b>distributed</b> to its unit holders because the company behind the fund wants to doesn't want to pay taxes on it. Since distributions <b>transfer</b> the tax burden onto the unitholder this allows the company to give out a larger portion of income generated from the fund because it isn’t taxed under them first. Besides distributions, unitholders also have the option of <b>redeeming</b> their units for a capital gain. When units are redeemed, the unitholder is <b>selling</b> their units back to the company in exchange for the current price of a unit. Fund companies keep a certain amount of cash on hand for redemptions to avoid having to <b>liquidate</b> positions in their portfolio.
  </p>

  <h6 class = 'underline'>Distributions</h6>

  <p>
    Distributions are generally given out <b>annually</b> and are on a <b>per unit</b> basis. Since the distribution is being taken out of the fund and being given to unit holders, the price of the unit will <b>decrease</b> by the distribution amount. For example, if the NAVPS of ABC Ltd. is <b>$10</b> and they decide to give out a <b>$1</b> distribution, the NAVPS of the fund will subsequently drop to <b>$9</b>. Most unit holders won't actually take the cash from the distributions but will instead <b>reinvest</b> whatever they get into more units of the fund. If they do choose to reinvest, their dollar amount invested in the fund will stay the exact same, the only difference being that they hold a few more units. The mutual fund company must disclose what the distribution was actually made up of whether it was capital gains, interest income, dividend income or a mix of them. If the mutual fund is held in a <b>registered account</b>(RESP, RRSP, TFSA,RIFF) it's not taxed, however if it's held in a <b>non registered account</b> it will undergo taxation. Because distributions tend to be given out near November and December, investors shouldn't buy units at that time because of the potential <b>tax consequences</b>.
  </p>

  <h6 class = 'underline'>How Mutual Funds are Priced</h6>

  <p>
    <b>Net Asset Value</b> is the value of the fund itself. The <b>total assets</b> are the market price of the securities held in the portfolio along with any cash reserves. The <b>total liabilities</b> are payments that are pending or financial obligations that the fund must meet. The NAV is generally calculated <b>daily</b> when all the underlying securities stop trading. The NAV is the primary measure of a fund’s <b>popularity</b> and sometimes even its success.
  </p>
  <div class="centre">

  <img class = "formula" src="images/nav.png" alt="">

</div>

<p><b>Net Asset Value Per Share</b> is the NAV divided by the total number of units <b>outstanding</b> and it's the price for which an investor will pay for 1 unit. Mutual fund orders are only executed once per day and it's after the market closes at 4pm ET in North America. This is done because a fund can be made up of 50-60 companies and the NAV is constantly fluctuating throughout the entire day, making it nearly impossible to determine a fair price at any given time. Therefore, after the NAV and NAVPS is calculated, orders for buying and redeeming units can be executied.
</p>
<div class="centre">

<img class = "formula" src="images/navps.png" alt="">

</div>



  <h6 class = 'underline'>Costs</h6>

  <p>
    From management expenses to operating expenses, a mutual fund incurs a number of costs throughout the year to ensure that the fund is as successful as possible. The <b>Management Expense Ratio</b>(MER) is the total fees and expenses a fund incurs over the year expressed as a percentage of the average NAV for the year. The MER of a typical fund is usually in the <b>0.5%-2%</b> but can be higher. In 2020, the RBC Global Tech Fund had a MER of 0.98% and had an average NAV of $347.8 million meaning they collected roughly $3.4 million over the given calendar year. The MER is taken out of the fund itself which means it reduces the NAV. To ensure that there isn't a significant drop in the NAV, funds tend to take out a small percentage of fees on a <b>daily</b> basis. For example if a fund's MER was 2%, everyday they would take out  <b>(2%/365) x NAV</b>. Everytime a fund reports its performance, it's <b>net</b> of the MER which means that it's already been accounted for.
  </p>
<p> <b>Note:</b> MER doesn't take into account the trading costs such as brokerage fees or commissions when buying and selling securities. The <b>Trading Expense Ratio</b>(Trading Costs/NAV) generally only applies to funds that hold equities but it's another important fee to take into consideration before buying into a mutual fund. </p>

  <h3 class = 'underline'>ETF</h3>
  <p>
<b>Exchange Traded Funds</b> are funds that are distributed to investors through an <b>exchange</b> instead of a distributor. Like mutual funds, they're a portfolio of financial securities which can be comprised of one or multiple asset classes. An ETF <b>provider</b>, someone who wants to create an ETF will enter into a contractual agreement with a <b>designated broker</b>. The broker represents a big investment dealer/company that has access to or can gain access to a large inventory of  shares which the provider is seeking. The broker gives the provider the desired shares and in return, receives a block of <b>ETF units</b>. The price of one unit of an ETF is calculated the same way as a mutual fund. Similar to mutual funds, an ETF's NAVPS is changing every second due to the securities held in the portfolio but unlike mutual funds, investors can execute orders throughout the trading day instead of once per day. If you recall with mutual funds, the NAVPS will rise and fall solely based on how the securities in the fund are performing but since ETFs are traded by the unit, the unit itself can be impacted by supply and demand. Due to this, they can trade slightly <b>above</b> or <b>below</b> their NAVPS but don't tend to deviate too far or too long from it.
</p>

</div>
<p>
  Just like mutual funds, realizing capital gains and receiving distributions are the two primary methods of making money from ETF’s. After accounting for their expenses, ETFs distribute <b>interest income</b> and <b>dividends</b> to their shareholders but rarely give out distributions that include <b>capital gains</b>. Usually, capital gains are distributed annually and generally only occur when shares have to be sold to prevent further loss or because they go against investment objectives. All in all, ETFs don’t undergo as many <b>taxable events </b>as mutual funds, leaving investors with larger returns. Most ETFs are based on a certain stock or bond index which means they offer lower MERs than index based mutual funds since trading and transaction costs are covered by the designated broker. Finally, the two key advantages of investing in ETFs over mutual funds are that they can be traded throughout the hours of an exchange and since they act like shares, they can be sold short just like any other security.

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Stock Index</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> Tracks the performance of a certain set of companies and is meant to help investors understand a certain market.</li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> is among the most popular indices which is looked at to determine the <b>health</b> of the US economy.</li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> The DJIA is made up of 30 large and established American companies from a wide range of sectiors including technology, financial services, energy and more.</li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> The DJIA is just the sum of the stock prices of all 30 companies divided by the <b>Dow Divisor</b>. The Dow Divisor is a number that’s used to keep the average <b>consistent</b> throughout history and reduce the effects on the index due to stock splits or companies leaving the index. As of now, it is 0.14748071991788.</li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> The Dow is a <b>price-weighted index</b> meaning that movement in larger priced stocks have a larger impact on the average. </li>
          <li><i class="fas fa-angle-right"></i> For example, if both Goldman Sachs and General Electric stock were to <b>increase</b> by $5 a share, the Goldman Sach stock would move the average much higher than the General Electric stock simply because it has a <b>larger</b> stock price.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
          Although there are many investors who stand by the DJIA, many believe that it’s not a good enough indicator of the US economy since it’s comprised of only 30 companies. Therefore, the <b>S&P 500 index</b> was created and is another well known index used for the same purpose as the Dow. The S&P 500 is a <b>weighted</b> index with the biggest companies having the heaviest weight. What this means is that any changes in the price of a stock that is heavily weighted will result in a     <b>greater overall change</b> in the index. Fluctuations in lower-weighted or smaller companies don’t have too great of an impact on the index as a whole. The S&P 500 is historically trending <b>upwards</b> which is why the index is widely used as a benchmark by investors to judge the success of their own portfolios. For example, if the S&P 500 gains 8% in a year and a fund manager happens to make a 12% return on their portfolio, they could say that they outperformed the market that year. In Canada, investors look at the <b>TSX/S&P composite index</b> which is made up of around 250 of the top companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Due to the close relationship of Canada and the US, Canadian investors tend to pay very close attention to the Dow and the S&P500 because changes in the US economy have global impacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Extra:</b> Changes in stock indices are generally reported by percentages. <a class = "link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQiqG3lv0fw" target = "_blank">Here</a> is a quick video explaining how percentage changes work and how to go about interpreting them.
        </p>

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Index Funds</h3>
        <p>
        Index funds were created as a <b>low cost</b> alternative for investors to reap the benefits of a growing stock index without having to buy shares in 250 or 500 different companies. An index fund can come in the form of a <b>mutual fund</b> or an <b>ETF</b> and its main purpose is to <b>mirror</b> a particular index and its <b>returns</b>. To achieve this, a fund manager buys the same stocks that make up a certain index and places them all into one portfolio. In theory, the manager’s portfolio should achieve the same return as its benchmark index. Most index funds use the <b>passive</b> investment strategy, which means that managers don’t have to rebalance (buy and sell shares) frequently. In comparison, some mutual funds and ETFs use <b>active</b> management which means that the fund manager is constantly looking at the fund’s performance and rebalancing accordingly. Passively managed funds have relatively <b>lower MERs</b> than those that are actively managed since a lot less time and effort is put into ensuring the fund is successful. Since an index fund is just a branch of a mutual fund or an ETF, distributions and tax liabilities work are almost identical to those investment vehicles.

        <h6 class = "underline">Canadian Pension Plan</h6>
        <p>

The <b>Canadian Pension Plan</b> was set up for the residents of Canada to pay into during their working years and collect payments from during their retirement. Every permanent resident above the age of 18 and below 65, earning at least $3,500 annually is <b>required</b> to pay into the CPP. The contribution amount is dependent on an individual’s <b>annual income </b>and can be found <a class = "link" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/canada-pension-plan-cpp/cpp-contribution-rates-maximums-exemptions.html" target = "_blank">here</a>. <b>Employers</b> are also required to <b>match</b> their employee’s CPP contributions. After the funds are collected from both the employer and employee, they go to the <b>Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board</b>. This is an organized group of financial professionals who’re responsible for investing all of Canada’s CPP contributions. The fund is among the largest institutional investors in Canada, managing upwards of <b>$456.7 billion</b>. The CPPIB holds international investments in public and private companies, as well as a variety of fixed income securities and even real estate holdings. The fund prioritizes investment strategies that don’t employ a large amount of risk while still providing generous returns. The CPPIB is an <b>independently run</b>  organization and doesn’t take any direction from the federal government regarding their investment decisions. The ultimate goal of the CPPIB is to provide Canadians with a stable amount of income during the final stage of their lives.

        <h6 class = "underline">Hedge Funds</h6>

        <p>

Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in the sense that capital is pooled together in order to buy and maintain a portfolio of financial securities. Although, the fundamental concept is similar, there are many differences that exist between the two. Starting off with the fact that only <b>accredited investors</b> are able to put money into hedge funds. In Canada, an individual with a net worth surpassing <b>$5 million</b> or making an annual gross income of more than <b>$200,000</b> is considered to be an accredited investor. The premise behind only letting accredited investors put money into the fund is that these investors are expected to have an above average understanding of the financial markets as well as an increased <b>risk tolerance</b>. The last thing hedge fund managers want is for the markets to dip and their investors panicking and running to take their money out. On top of being an accredited investor, a significant amount of capital has to be invested with the minimum investment ranging anywhere from <b>$100,000</b> to <b>$2 million</b>.

        </p>


        <p>
          Capital that is invested into a hedge fund can be used however the hedge fund manager see’s best fit. Hedge fund managers employ <b>high risk</b> investment practices in order to achieve their desired returns. This can include <b>short selling</b>, the use of <b>options</b> and many other riskier strategies which mutual funds simply cannot do. When used correctly, these strategies can provide a considerable return for not only the investors but for the managers as well. Hedge fund managers have a fee structure set up that in some cases allow them to make upwards of <b>20%</b> of the overall annual profits of the fund. Depending on who you ask they’ll say it’s a fair structure because ultimately the fund manager played the biggest part in achieving that return. However, it’s important to understand that some fund managers struggle to make profits and can even report lower returns than mutual funds at times. As for the structure, there’s a <b>limited liability</b>  structure in most hedge funds with the investors only being liable for their own investment. This means that they can only lose as much as they put in and profits are divided according to the size of the initial investment.

        <h3 class = 'underline'>Online Brokerages</h3>

        <p>

          Entering and exiting the market has become a fairly simple task throughout the years. The growth of online brokerages have made it easier than ever for the average investor to gain access to the financial markets. In Canada, the top five banks: RBC, ScotiaBank, BMO, CIBC and TD all have dedicated online platforms for their clients to place their trades independently. When executing trades, all the user see’s is their trade being filled but there’s a lot going behind the scenes. Take RBC or Wealth Simple for example, they’re acting as <b>brokers</b> which means that they’re <b>middleman</b> that connects a client to a certain marketplace(exchange). Without the broker, users would not be able to access the markets and make trades. The brokerage makes money by charging <b>transaction fees</b> every time a user enters and exits the markets. These fees can be rather expensive and reduce the overall returns that the average investor makes. More recently, independent companies like Wealth Simple and Quest Trade have been steadily rising in popularity due to their <b>low fees</b> and <b>transaction costs</b>. These companies even allow investors to open TFSA’s and RRSP’s to store their securities and execute their trades.
